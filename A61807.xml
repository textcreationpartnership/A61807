            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop. I.</hi> That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not only fallible, but had actually erred.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop. II.</hi> That her Errors were not ſlight, and in Matters of ſmall Moment; but ſo groſs and enormous, when the Reformation was ſet on foot, that there was a neceſſity of reforming them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop. III.</hi> That no hope was left, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would either reform theſe Errors in her ſelf, or give conſent to the Reformation of them in any other Church that communicated with her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop. IV.</hi> That every Particular National Church, had a Right to reform it ſelf without her leave.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop. V.</hi> That this Right of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in particular, was unqueſtionable; And therefore as a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Concluſion from theſe Premiſſes.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:48724:4"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>Prop. VI.</hi> That the Church of <hi>England</hi> was indiſpenſably obliged to reform her ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The two firſt of which Propoſitions having been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy proved, in a foregoing Diſcourſe, the third comes next in order to be treated of.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Which tho it contains theſe two Propoſitions;</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there was no hope that ſhe would reform thoſe Errors in her ſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That there was no hope that ſhe would conſent to the Reformation of them in any other Church that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated with here therein: Yet becauſe the latter of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>heſe will plainly follow from the proof of the former, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hall therefore inſiſt upon that only.</p>
               <p>Tho her Corruptions were numerous, and many of them in their Nature and Conſequence very dangerous; yet if ſhe could have been perſuaded to purge them out, and return to her Primitive Purity, the Proteſtants would have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the Reformation from her Hands, and have hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thanked her for it. But alas, there was no hope left, that ſhe would ever be cleanſed; but the greateſt reaſon
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48724:4"/> to fear, that <hi>She that was filthy, would be filthy ſtill.</hi> As will be manifeſt by the following Conſiderations. For;</p>
               <p>1. Could there be any juſt ground of hope, that ſhe would ever reform, after ſhe had obſtinately refuſed, and ſhewed her ſelf incorrigible, notwithſtanding thoſe fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Complaints, that for many Ages had been made againſt her Corruptions, by many great Men, both Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical and Secular, of her own Communion? Paſſing over thoſe that are more remote, I ſhall take notice of the Complaints of later Ages only.</p>

               <p>2. The Reformation of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was yet more hopeleſs, becauſe not only theſe, but many other Attempts made toward it, had by the Pope and his Court been already defeated.

Could they be otherwiſe than inſignificant, as long as the cauſes of theſe Corruptions were ſtill maintained, and no proviſion made for putting the Canons in execution? For the Pope to talk of reviving the ancient Canons, without firſt reforming his own Court, from whence the neglect and contempt of theſe Canons mainly proceeded, was as abſurd, as to go about to cleanſe the Stream, while the Fountain remains polluted.

               <p>I need ſay no more; Nor was it indeed needful to ſay ſo much, ſince I might have ſpared the pains of proving that, which was ſo notorious by the event. I appeal to the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> themſelves, whether Corruptions and Abuſes did not more abound; and whether Complaints againſt them were not more loud and clamorous, after the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Council, than before?

               <p>Muſt not he then be a fond Man, who could hope for a good Reformation from the Biſhops of <hi>Rome?</hi> A Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation! there was nothing in the World they were ſo averſe from; Death and Hell were not more odious to them. And why? This would wreſt the Temporal Sword quite out of their Hands, and tumble the Triple Crown from their Heads; they muſt then quit claim to their U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Empire, and be content with their ancient En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſure, the Suburbicary Region: Their Diſpenſations and Commutations, their Pardons and Indulgences, and a thouſand Crafts more, by which they get their Wealth, would then be ſet at nought. In brief, they would then be diveſted of their uſurped Power and Greatneſs, and rendred as poor and deſpiſed, as the Crow in the Fable, when ſtrip'd of thoſe fine Feathers he had pluck'd from others.

               <p n="5">5. The Reformation was yet more hopeleſs, becauſe the Biſhops, and the reſt of the governing part of the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, were ſeveral ways engaged to ſubmit themſelves to, and follow the Pope's Conduct: So that ſuppoſing they had any good wiſhes for a Reformation themſelves, yet both their Tongues and their Hands were ſo tied up, that they might neither ſpeak, nor act, for the promoting of it, without leave firſt obtained from his Holineſs.

               <p n="1">1. That the Pope's Title was then diſputed. For that Council was ſummoned by the Cardinals, on purpoſe to extinguiſh the Schiſm, that had been long before rais'd, and was then continued by the two Anti-Popes, <hi>Greg.</hi> XII. and <hi>Benet.</hi> XIII. <note n="(t)" place="margin">Bin. Praefat. ad Concil. Conſtant. Richer. Hiſt. Concil. General. l. 2. c. 2.</note>. Nor was the Council able to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine which of the two was the rightful Pope. Tho there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Biſhops had ſworn Obedience to the Pope, yet in that caſe, their Oath did not oblige them to obey one ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the other; that is, to obey either of them. And as they were looſed from the Bond of Conſcience, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could the Temptation from Intereſt then take place. For as there was in effect no Pope (ſince it could not be known who he was) ſo it was uncertain who would in the end obtain the Popedom; whether either of thoſe who thought it his due, or ſome other Perſon who did not yet pretend a Title to it. And ſo indeed it happened, for thoſe who laid claim to it, were by the Council both rejected, and another choſen, to whoſe lot the diſpoſal of thoſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments fell, which the Pope's Paraſites gape after.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The two Anti-Popes (beſides other enormous Crimes) were both convicted of notorious Hereſy <note n="(u)" place="margin">Seſſ. 9, 10, 11, 15.</note>. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in caſe they had been duly elected, had loſt their Right to the Papacy.

Let it be granted, That <hi>John</hi> XXIII (who ſucceeded <hi>Alex.</hi> V.) was own'd by the Council for the true and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Pope, (as indeed he was by the major part) yet he had forfeited his Title to the Papacy theſe two ways eſpecially. 1. By Hereſy. 'Tis true, that Hereſy is not mention'd in the Sentence paſs'd againſt him, as that for which he was condemned; yet 'tis alſo true, That as he was accuſed of

Yea, that in this caſe he may be legally depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the Romaniſts muſt grant; if they conſider, That for this very cauſe <hi>John</hi> XII was depoſed by a Council <note n="e" place="margin">Luit. prand. de re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Imperat. &amp; Reg. l. 6. c. 7, 8, 9, 10.</note>, the Legality of which hath been own'd, and its Acts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, by the conſtant Tradition of the Roman Church; and among others, by three Cardinals, who were vehement Aſſertors of the Popes Prerogatives, as <hi>Launoy</hi> hath proved at large againſt <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Binius</hi> 
                  <note n="f" place="margin">Launoii Epiſt. parte quarta ad Lud. Maraeſium.</note>. The ſame is alſo confirmed by the concurrent Judgment of learned Divines of the Romiſh Church, of which you may find a great number in the Epiſtle now quoted. 3. Before the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil proceeded to accuſe and condemn him, the ancient Doctrine was eſtabliſh'd as an Article of Faith, namely, <hi>That a General Council is above the Pope</hi> 
                  <note n="g" place="margin">Seſſ. 4.</note>. I know <hi>Plati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> tells us, That they firſt depos'd him, and paſs'd this Decree afterward in their own defence <note n="h" place="margin">Plat. in vita Johan.</note>. But he that will take the pains to read the Hiſtory of the Council, will plainly ſee, that <hi>Platina</hi> was miſtaken. For this Decree was made in the fourth Seſſion, whereas he was not depos'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the twelfth; it being then a point of Faith in this Council, That the Biſhops, who in their ſingle capacities are the Pope's Subjects, when met in Council, are raiſed to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48724:13"/> a Soveraignty over him; that Oath which they had ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally taken as his Subjects, they concluded did now ceaſe to oblige them, when become his Soveraign. As the Oath of Obedience which a Prieſt takes to his Biſhop binds him, as long as he remains a bare Prieſt; but if he be once ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to be the Biſhop's Metropolitan, is of no force.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As to the Council of <hi>Baſil</hi> (omitting many others), I ſhall propoſe theſe two things; Firſt, That this Council depended on the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> as a River on its Fountain; it being the Execution of the Decrees of the iv, v, xxxix, xl, &amp; xliv Seſſions of that Council <note n="i" place="margin">Richer. l. 3. c. 1.</note>. 2. In the Council of <hi>Baſil,</hi> the Biſhops were ſet free from their Oaths of Subjection to the Pope, by the Pope himſelf; firſt, by <hi>Martin</hi> V, who had confirm'd thoſe Decrees of the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> which made the Pope ſubject to a Gen. Council <note n="k" place="margin">Concil. Conſt. Seſſ. 45. Rich. l. 2. c. 3. §. 23. Maimb. <hi>Prerog. of the Church of</hi> Rome, c. 21.</note>. Secondly, by <hi>Eugenius</hi> IV, who ratified the ſame Decrees of the Council of <hi>Baſil</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Plat. in vit. Eugenii.</note>, and that before the Council had proceeded to any judicial Act againſt him <note n="‖" place="margin">Richer. l. 3. c. 3. §. 1. Maimb. <hi>Prerog. of the Church of</hi> Rome, c. 21.</note>. So that now the Biſhops when met in a General Council, repreſenting the whole Church, by the Pope's own Act were made his Superiours; and therefore the Oath they had before taken of Subjection to him as ſingle Perſons, was now out of doors. But when the next <hi>Lateran Council</hi> came, the caſe was quite alter'd, the Pope was then mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above a Council; and his Supremacy, and their Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction owned by them, and by the ſucceeding Council of <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſum of what hath been ſaid, may be reduced to theſe four Heads, which quite evacuate the force of the <hi>Objection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That in the Councils of <hi>Piſa</hi> and <hi>Conſtance,</hi> the caſe with reſpect to the Pope, was as different from what it was,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48724:13"/> and ever will be, when there is a Pope whoſe Right is not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, as the caſe of Subjects under a Prince, whoſe Title is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable, from what it is under many Pretenders, who are not able to make out their Claim. The Subjects are oblig'd in Conſcience, and uſually by Intereſt, to obey the former, but by neither, to obey the latter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Suppoſe their Title was at firſt unqueſtionable, yet they loſt it by Hereſy, Schiſm, and their prodigiouſly ſcandalous Vices.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In the Councils of <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil,</hi> it was reckon'd a Point of Faith, That the Biſhops change their place in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Pope, when united in a General Council; and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, were no more bound by the Oath they had taken to the Pope, than a Servant who ſwears Obedience to his Maſter is, in caſe he ceaſe to be his Servant, and his Maſter become Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to him. And,</p>
               <p n="4">4. In the Council of <hi>Baſil,</hi> the Pope himſelf had ſet the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops free from their Oath of Subjection to him, by voluntarily ſubjecting himſelf to them.</p>
               <p>By this time it is, I think, evident enough, that (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this Exception in an extraordinary caſe) the Reaſons before mentioned ſtand good. But what need I prove, that the Sun is up at Noon? The Reaſon, the Senſe, and common Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Mankind, do all tell us; that as Men who have any Religion, cannot but have a great Veneration for an Oath: ſo on the other hand; that they who have none, cannot but be ſway'd by their worldly Intereſts: <hi>Where the Carcaſs is, thither will the Eagles reſort.</hi> Since therefore the governing part of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> were ſo miſerably enſlaved to the Roman Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, could there be any hope of Reformation, when there was no reaſon to hope that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> would conſent to it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> Some perhaps may ſay, that I wrong the Popes, in repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting them as ſo obſtinately ſet againſt Reformation. For as many of them pretended a Zeal for it; ſo 'tis certain there was one at leaſt (viz. <hi>Adrian</hi> VI.) who did himſelf earneſtly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> But what kind of Reformation was it he endeavoured to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48724:14"/> make? In matters of Faith, and of the Sacraments, he would allow no Man liberty, ſo much as to diſpute what had been once decreed by General Councils <note n="l" place="margin">Soave l. 1. p. 25. Sleid. Comment. l. 4.</note>, that is, by any of thoſe Councils which he called General, many of which were no more than Italian or Papal Councils. Whoſoever was ſo bold, as to call any ſuch thing in queſtion, he was to be dealt with as <hi>John Huſs</hi> and <hi>Hierom</hi> of <hi>Prague</hi> 
                  <note n="m" place="margin">Soav. ibid.</note>; ſo that if any Man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the imaginary Fire of Purgatory, he muſt preſently be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by real Flames.</p>
               <p>The Popes uſurp'd Power and Greatneſs (the ſource of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs other Corruptions) ſo far was he from retrenching, that he rather endeavoured to ſet it higher. The Princes of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> were looked upon as too ſawcy, and thought to entrench upon his Prerogative, for deſiring only, <hi>that a Council might be called with the Emperor's Conſent</hi> 
                  <note n="n" place="margin">Soav. l. 1. p. 28.</note>.</p>
               <p>What then was the Reformation <hi>Adrian</hi> aimed at? Why, the Church-men were in their Morals ſo monſtrouſly degenerated, that in almoſt all places they were become abominable: The Abuſes in Diſcipline were grown ſo intolerable, that the Princes of the World were reſolved no longer to endure them: That therefore which he deſigned was, to reduce the Clergy to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what better Manners, and to correct ſome groſs Enormities in Diſcipline, which were moſt offenſive. This was all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation he endeavoured; for other Corruptions, ſo far was it from his intention to reform them, that he was reſolved more firmly to eſtabliſh them. And yet this piece of Reformation he did not effect, tho he much deſired it. Which leads me to another Conſideration, which further ſhews how hopeleſs the Reformation of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was. For,</p>
               <p>6. Let us ſuppoſe, That ſuch a Man had been advanced to the Papacy, who would have ſet himſelf in good earneſt to make an impartial Reformation (one of the moſt unlikely things in the World, as the ſtate of that Church then was, and for a long time before had been) he would have fail'd in his Attempt, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48724:14"/> not have been able to accompliſh it. And that for theſe two Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: 1. Becauſe he could have made no ſuch Reformation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he firſt made void thoſe Obligations, by which the governing part of that Church, both in point of Conſcience and of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, were held in ſubjection to him. 2. Becauſe of that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, which, they being ſo let looſe, would for the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty have made againſt him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe he could have made no ſuch Reformation, unleſs he firſt made void thoſe Obligations, by which the governing part of that Church, both in point of Conſcience and Intereſt, were of held in ſubjection to him. The great holds he had upon their Conſciences, proceeded from ſeveral corrupt Doctrines, and thoſe Practices of the Popes that were built upon them. For inſtance, That the Pope is by Divine Ordination Head of the Univerſal Church; that all other Biſhops are his Subjects, and that he hath power to impoſe an Oath upon them, as their Soveraign; that he is the Supream Judg of Controverſies, and all Men oblig'd to ſtand to his Sentence. Theſe, and ſeveral other Doctrines of a reſembling nature, have been defined by the Popes themſelves, and with great Zeal aſſerted as unqueſtionable Truths, by their Flatterers; and had been ſo far owned by the governing Clergy, that they had bound themſelves by ſolemn Oath (has as been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſhew'd) to be obedient to him.</p>
               <p>But now no Reformation to purpoſe could have been made, but the Pope muſt condemn theſe Doctrines, and diveſt himſelf of thoſe Prerogatives, which, by virtue of them, he lays claim to: Becauſe theſe are not only great Errors themſelves, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of all other the groſſeſt Corruptions <note n="o" place="margin">Richer. Hiſt. Concil. General. l. 1. c. 13.</note>.</p>
               <p>Nor muſt he only looſe the tie of Conſcience, but that of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt too (which with the generallity of Men, is the ſtronger of the two). He muſt no longer aſſume to himſelf the ſole power of erecting, and pulling down of Biſhopricks; of electing, confirming, depoſing and reſtoring of Biſhops; of diſpoſing of all the greater Dignities and Eccleſiaſtical Benefices; of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48724:15"/> thoſe that are incompatible upon the ſame Perſon: In a word, of trampling upon all the ancient Canons. And ſhould the Pope have once parted with theſe Prerogatives, together with many other of the like nature, which muſt have been done if a Reformation had been made to purpoſe, he would have been able to do nothing more. For,</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Prelats (as has been before ſhew'd) <note n="(h)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Firſt part, p.</hi> 55, 56, 57.</note> were ſo deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſunk into Earthlineſs and Senſuality, that there was nothing they would have more vehemently oppoſed than a Reformation. This they gave a ſufficient proof of, in that they were ſo diſtaſted with that Confeſſion of their Exceſſes, which <hi>Adrian</hi> made to the Diet at <hi>Nuremberg</hi> 
                  <note n="(i)" place="margin">Soave l. 1. p. 29.</note>: For if the bare <hi>Confeſſion</hi> of their Faults was ſo diſpleaſing, how much more grievous would the <hi>reforming</hi> of them have been? Which tho <hi>Adrian</hi> likewiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, yet how unable he would have been to perform it, we may conclude from that ill ſucceſs he met with in <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf: For tho he reſolv'd to reform Abuſes at home, before he ſent his Legat to treat with the Princes of <hi>Germany;</hi> yet he met with ſo much difficulty in the Attempt, that he was forced to quit his Reſolution <note n="(k)" place="margin">P. 24.</note>. And can it be ſuppos'd that he ſhould be able to reform the Univerſal Church, who could not correct the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders of his own Court <note n="(l)" place="margin">Palpabiliter cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitur, ipſam ejus Curiam, maxima indigere Reformatione, ſicut omnia clamaverunt ultimo celebrata Generalia Concilia.

And therefore after he had made ſome trial of his ſtrength, and found how unequal it was to his undertaking, he ſaid to his familiar Friends, <hi>That the condition of the Popes was very miſerable, ſince matters were come to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable paſs, that tho they never ſo much deſired it, yet they were not able to reform the Church</hi>

               <p>And what was the reaſon he was not able to effect what he ſo earneſtly endeavoured? One main reaſon doubtleſs was, that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48724:15"/> he in ſome meaſure let looſe that Tie which he had upon them from their worldly Intereſts. No plurality of Benefices with cure of Souls was to be expected from him; <hi>He was reſolved,</hi> as he ſaid, <hi>to adorn Churches with Prieſts, and not Prieſts with Churches</hi>

               <p>The plain conſequence of what hath been ſaid, is this; That the Reformation of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> muſt needs be very hopeleſs; ſince the Pope himſelf, tho he ſhould have ſeriouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd it, could not have made it; becauſe he could not have made it without doing that, (which as the caſe of that Church then ſtood) would have diſabl'd him to make it. A deſperate caſe indeed! when it could not be effected, whether the Pope were for it, or againſt it: If the the Pope were againſt it, the reſt of the Prelats were not able without him to compaſs it; if the Pope were for it, he muſt in order to it, do that which would have rendred him unable to compaſs it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> If it be objected, That the Reformations attempted in the Councils of <hi>Conſtance, Baſil,</hi> and the laſt <hi>Piſan,</hi> are an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Argument, that the Romiſh Biſhops were not generally ſo averſe from a Reformation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer. 1. That in the Councils of <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil,</hi> many of the Biſhops were over-aw'd by the good Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <hi>Sigiſmund,</hi> whoſe Authority at that time bore a much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſway, than the Popes. 2. In theſe Councils, the inferiour Clergy had a deciſive voice, which was denied them in the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding <hi>Florentine, Lateran,</hi> and <hi>Trent</hi> Councils. And <hi>Ludovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> Cardinal of <hi>Arles,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Segovia.</hi> (whoſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in this matter is unqueſtionable) aſſure us, that it was not the Biſhops, but the inferior Clergy, by which Matters were carried in the Council of <hi>Baſil</hi> for the Reformation, and againſt
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48724:16"/> the Pope <note n="p" place="margin">Aeneae Sylv. Comment. l. 1. p. 29, 34.</note>. 3. 'Twas but a piece of Reformation theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils deſign'd, and that not the moſt conſiderable. <hi>Thoſe demands of Reformation in the Head and Members,</hi> ſays the Cardinal of <hi>Perron, propounded before the laſt diviſion of the Church, have been demands of Reformation, not in the Doctrine of Faith, and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, but in Manners, and in the practice of Eccleſiaſtical Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, which even theſe words of Reformation both in the Head and Members, principally uſed in the time of the Councils of</hi> Conſtance <hi>and</hi> Baſil <hi>ſignifie</hi> 
                  <note n="q" place="margin">
                     <hi>Reply to the King of Great</hi> Brit. l. 4. c. 30.</note>. And thoſe matters of Diſcipline they aim'd at, were ſuch as did almoſt all concern the Exorbitances of the Pope and his Court, as appears by the eighteen Articles of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion propoſed in the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> 
                  <note n="r" place="margin">Seſſ. 40.</note>. And therefore no wonder if the Biſhops did the more eaſily yield their Conſent to them. 4. Tho the ſecond <hi>Piſan</hi> Council voted a Reformation both in Faith and Manners. Yet it is ſufficiently known, That that Reformation was reſolved upon to ſerve a Deſign againſt the Inſolencies of the preſent Pope, in oppoſition to whom that Council was called, by ſome of the Cardinals who had been diſgrac'd and inſolently treated by him. Tho even that was a plain Argument of the neceſſity of it, and how earneſtly it was deſired by the Chriſtian World.</p>
               <p>But becauſe in diſcourſing afterward upon the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> I ſhall have occaſion to ſay thoſe things, which will be more than an Anſwer to this Objection, I ſhall only at preſent add, That if the Biſhops were not generally abandoned to Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, Covetouſneſs, Sloth, and Senſuality, 'tis not I, but the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Writers themſelves that ſlander them. For this I appeal to <hi>Marſilius</hi> of <hi>Padua, Nicolas Clemangis,</hi> the German Biſhop who wrote the Book call'd <hi>Onus Eccleſiae,</hi> Father <hi>Paul;</hi> yea even to Pope <hi>Pius</hi> II himſelf, before he was Pope, Cardinal, or Biſhop, who in his Comments upon the Council of <hi>Baſil,</hi> hath left on record this ſad Complaint, (among many others) of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of <hi>Arles; Alas, at this day a Prelat who does not prefer temporal things before thoſe that are ſpiritual, is rarely found!</hi> 
                  <note n="s" place="margin">De Geſt. Concil. Baſ. l. 1. fol. 12.</note>.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:48724:16"/> 7. There is one Conſideration ſtill behind, which of it ſelf (without the Aſſiſtance of any of thoſe fore-mention'd) amounts to no leſs than a Demonſtration; <hi>viz.</hi> That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was ſo remote from reforming her Errors, that ſhe would not be brought to acknowledg, that ſhe could err in any of her Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but on the contrary, condemn'd them for Hereticks, who did not take her moſt palpable Errors for unqueſtionable Truths. And tho the Romaniſts cannot agree among themſelves about the ſubject of this Infallibility; but if you ask them where, or in whom it is ſeated? they anſwer with confuſion of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, like that of <hi>Babel;</hi> yet they all agree in this, That they have it ſomewhere, and make this the Foundation into which they reſolve their Faith.</p>
               <p>Now what hope can there be of curing that Perſon, who is ſo far from ſeeking out for a Remedy, that he will by no means hear that he is ſo much as capable of being ſick? Such was the condition of the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> Tho ſhe was ſick, even nigh unto Death; yet ſhe would not endure thoſe who ſaid no more, than that it was poſſible ſhe might not be well. This rendred her Diſeaſe abſolutely incurable.</p>
               <p>Though the Arguments produc'd, will, I queſtion not, be thought ſatisfactory by all diſintereſs'd Judges: yet it cannot be expected, but ſome Perſons will be found, who will think they can eaſily confute them by plain matter of Fact; that is, by ſhewing, that the Reformation ſo much deſired before, and in <hi>Luther</hi>'s time, has been long ſince made. If they can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed do this, it muſt be granted, That theſe, and all other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of the like import, are no better than Fallacies. For as <hi>Diogenes</hi> ſufficiently confuted <hi>Zeno</hi> (who denied the poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Motion) by riſing and actually moving; ſo if any Man can ſhew, That thoſe Errors and Corruptions ſo much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd of, have by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> been reform'd, he muſt be not only abſur'd, but impudent, who ſhall ſtill aſſert, That the Reformation was deſperate. And to convince you, That this Reformation has indeed been made, they will ſend you no farther than the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> in which they will
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48724:17"/> tell you, this work was ſo compleatly done, that nothing was left undone, that could be thought needful to a thorough Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</p>
               <p>This being the thing which the Romaniſts chiefly inſiſt upon, and make their boaſt of: That my Anſwer may be the more full and ſatisfactory, it will not be amiſs to ſpend a little time in ſhewing what ſort of Reformation it was, that was made by that Council; by which it will be manifeſt, how much they endeavour to impoſe upon the World, who repreſent it as a Reformation ſo entire, that nothing of moment, can by any unprejudic'd Perſon be found wanting in it.</p>
               <p>'Tis confeſſed; That as that Council was call'd, as the Pope pretended, for the Reformation of the Church; ſo that in purſuance of that Pretence, many Decrees concerning Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation were made by it: But that the Reformation they made ſuch a noiſe about, was indeed no more than Noiſe (a great Cry and no Wool) deſigned to abuſe Princes, and to put a cheat upon the World, by amuſing them with the name, that they might beguile them of the thing, will, I think, ſo plainly appear by the ſequel of this Diſcourſe, that thoſe whoſe great Intereſt it is not to confeſs it, will ſcarce have the face to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it.</p>
               <p>But becauſe two famous Jeſuits, namely, <hi>Scipio Henricus,</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Pallavicino,</hi> have made it their buſineſs to blaſt the Credit of the Hiſtory of this Council, written by Father <hi>Paul,</hi> by repreſenting it to the World as a ſlanderous Libel, made up in great part of malicious Forgeries: before I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, it may not be amiſs to vindicate its Credit from their falſe Imputations, though it be not indeed neceſſary in order to that which I intend; becauſe the Charge I ſhall draw up againſt the Council, will not be taken from that Hiſtory alone, but from other Authors, and for the moſt part from the Decrees and Canons of the Council it ſelf.</p>

                  <hi>THE Credit of the Hiſtory will be ſufficiently clear'd by ſhewing theſe two things:</hi> 1. How well the Hiſtorian was qualified for the work. 2.

                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Credit of any Hiſtory bears proportion to the Authority of the Writer; and the Authority of the Writer, to his ſufficiency for the Work, and his ſincerity in perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it: By how much the greater his knowledge was of the things he delivers, and by how much the greater evidence there is of his ſincerity in delivering them; by ſo much the greater is his Authority; and by conſequence, ſo much the more unqueſtionable the truth of his Hiſtory. In caſe then there be no reaſon to ſuſpect, that the Writer is defective in either of theſe Qualifications; but a Perſon of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable Ability, and approved Sincerity, there can be no reaſon to queſtion the truth of what he relates; but on the contrary the greateſt reaſon in the World to entertain it as a <hi>faithful ſaying.</hi> To apply this to the Hiſtorian we now treat of:</p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:48724:18"/>
                  <p> 1. No Man can doubt of <hi>Soave</hi>'s Ability, who conſiders, That he wanted neither that Judgment nor thoſe means of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation that were needful to qualifie him for ſuch a Work.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He could not want Judgment, who was the Miracle of his age for all ſorts of Learning: Not only for ſuch, as are wont to be found in Cloyſters; but ſuch alſo, by which the Phyſician, the Lawyer, the Gentleman and the Stateſman are recommended to the World: and particularly, for his Skill in Hiſtory, both Sacred and Profane, (as may be ſeen in his Life, written by <hi>Fulgentius.)</hi> To which if we add, That he wrote this Hiſtory, not in his greener years, but when his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding was fully ripe, we muſt needs grant, that he had a ſufficient talent of Judgment and Diſcretion for ſuch a Work. So admirable indeed was his Judgment in all matters, <hi>That</hi> (as the Author of his Life tells us) <hi>never any thing was propoſed to him, whereto he did not as readily and ſolidly anſwer, as if it had been in his only Profeſſion; and he gave no anſwer ſo ſuddenly, that ſeem'd not to be long and ſtudiouſly conſider'd of, and ſuch an one as could not be better'd</hi>

To which if we add, That for a long time he gather'd with extream di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, whatſoever he could attain to know concerning this great Affair, either by Coſt or Friendſhip, not only in <hi>Italy,</hi> but from abroad, ſparing neither Labour nor Mony, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imagine, but he was ſufficiently furniſhed with Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Materials for this Work <note n="†" place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 97.</note>.</p>
                  <p>I know <hi>Pallavicino</hi> repreſents Father <hi>Paul,</hi> as one who col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected his Hiſtory from thoſe who were either ſuſpected for Hereticks, or were really ſuch <note n="q" place="margin">Pallav. Apparat. ad Hiſt. <hi>c.</hi> 4.</note>. The falſity of which Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation, is ſo manifeſt by what hath been already ſaid, that it needs no further Confutation. But becauſe it is not ſo much the want of ability, as of ſincerity, that Father <hi>Paul</hi> is by his Adverſaries charged with; Conſider,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the Arguments of his Sincerity are ſo bright, that he muſt be either blind, or wink hard, that can avoid the ſight of them. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He was a Perſon exemplary for Piety, Modeſty, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, Charity, Forgiveneſs of Injuries, and all other Virtues both Chriſtian and Moral, as Father <hi>Fulgentius</hi> (who moſt intimately knew him) tells us. Even in his Youth, ſays he, he was never reprehended for ſpeaking an undecent word, or doing an unbeſeeming act <note n="r" place="margin">
                        <hi>Life, p.</hi> 16.</note>. Can it then be ſuppos'd, that in his elder age, he ſhould publiſh to the World a Book fraught with malicious Lyes?</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:48724:19"/> 2. To what purpoſe, can we ſuppoſe, he ſhould report things otherways than he knew them to be? Men are not wont to play the Knave, for nought, but in hope of ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, which may accrue to themſelves thereby; and the Baits by which they are allured, are either the <hi>luſt of the Fleſh,</hi> or the <hi>luſt of the Eye,</hi> or the <hi>pride of Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the <hi>luſt of the Fleſh,</hi> he was ſo mortified, that he drank nothing but Water till he had paſſed the <hi>30th</hi> Year of his Age; and then not without much averſeneſs, was he prevail'd with by his Phyſicians, in order to his Health, to drink Wine; and among other things, which he repented himſelf of, this was one; <hi>that he had been perſwaded to the uſe of Wine.</hi> His Food was ſo ſlender, that for the moſt part he eat nothing but Bread and Fruits; of Fleſh very little, till he had paſſed his <hi>55th</hi> Year. His Life was the moſt toilſome and painful, that any Religious Man was able to lead <note n="ſ" place="margin">
                        <hi>See his Life, P.</hi> 18. 20, 156, &amp; paſſim.</note>.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>luſt of the Eye,</hi> had ſo little power over him, That he never had of Money any more, than was neceſſary for a days uſe; though he had daily opportunities of heaping up Riches. He yielded his ſervice freely in all cauſes, without receiving any Recognition whatſoever. And though many attempted to fix a Gift upon him, yet he never received the leaſt Gratuity; <hi>being always content with this only Reward, of having done well</hi> 
                     <note n="t" place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 132, 133.</note>.</p>
                  <p>And for the <hi>Pride of Life,</hi> he ſo much deſpiſed it; That he not only not deſired, but refuſed to accept many great Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and Preferments that were offered him; and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ſpend his life in a Cell, ſo far from any manner of Pomp and State, that he never had any Ornament for his Chamber, nor more than one ſimple Garment to put on. In ſhort, the manifeſt truth is; that had he ſought after world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Glory or Greatneſs in any kind, his Temptations lay all on the other hand; for would he but have humour'd, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48724:20"/> flatter'd the Pope, and his Court, he might have eaſily been advanced, to be the chief Miniſter of State under him <note n="u" place="margin">Et ſi Papae adulari aſſentarique animum induxiſſet, Miniſtrorum Pontificiae do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minationis facile Princeps.</note>.</p>
                  <p>It is, I know, ſaid by ſome, that all this was to get a Name. But what can be ſaid with leſs pretence of Truth or Reaſon? ſince this was that he ſtudiouſly declined. How many uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Inventions does the World owe to him, which he would not own himſelf to be the Author of? How many ſecrets did he diſcover, which he was pleaſed others ſhould have the honour to publiſh, as if they had been Theirs? How reſolute was he to leave nothing behind him, either of his own hand, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mens that might carry his name, or preſerve his memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note n="w" place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 157. 158, 159.</note>? And had his deſign been to render himſelf infamous to all ſucceeding Generations, the belying of the Council, had been a moſt proper means in order to this end; there being thoſe memorials in many Mens hands in <hi>France,</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> by which the Falſity might be detected, and he expoſed to the reproach of all the World.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But be it ſo, that none of the flattering temptations were able to corrupt him; yet 'tis certain (ſay others) <hi>that having been highly diſobliged by the Pope and his Court, he was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be reveng'd for the wrongs they had done him.</hi> Which aſperſion is eaſily wiped off by conſidering theſe two things: 1. His wonderful Charity, not only in Giving, but Forgiving. 2. How earneſtly he endeavoured, when he had the greateſt provocations to the contrary imaginable, to conceal thoſe things, that might reflect Diſgrace upon the Religion he profeſſed. Of both which Father <hi>Fulgentio</hi> hath given us pregnant Proofs in his life. When he was treacherouſly Aſſaulted, and barbarouſly Wounded (by wretches hired by the Pope to murder him) what was his Revenge? <hi>He pray'd the high Council often, that as he with all his heart did pardon him that offended, ſo</hi>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:48724:20"/> 
                     <hi>they would make no other demonſtration of it, but what might ſerve to defend him better, if God ſhould pleaſe to prolong his Life; expreſſing in his actions as a Chriſtian, and Son of the Heavenly Father, his due obedience to the Goſpel; and as a Philoſopher, that he had eradicated out of his Soul all ſpirit of Revenge</hi> 
                     <note n="x" place="margin">
                        <hi>Life, P.</hi> 123. 124.</note>. And when it was reported, not many hours after, that the Aſſaſſins were apprehended, <hi>he ſeemed to be much diſpleaſed at the news, ſaying, Perhaps they may diſcover ſomething, that may give ſcandal to the World, and prejudice to Religion</hi> 
                     <note n="y" place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 126.</note>. when another Plot againſt his Life was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd, inſtead of making a requital, <hi>he interceded for the Murderers, and that not ſlightly, but petition'd often upon his Knees, demanding this as a favour in recompence of his beſt ſervices done for the Publick, that for his ſake, they ſhould not be made ſpectacles, to the diſhonour of his Religion</hi> 
                     <note n="z" place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 144.</note>. When not only his Life, but (which is more) his Honour was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacqu'd by the moſt opprobrious <hi>Libels, he never ſhew'd the leaſt ſign either of Diſdain, or Revenge. In ſuch perfection was his meekneſs, that thoſe of his Religion, with a general Voice render'd him this Teſtimony, that they never knew him endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour any the leaſt kind of Revenge</hi> 
                     <note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 148.</note>. And 'tis <hi>Fulgentio</hi>'s Note upon his Charity expreſſed toward his Aſſaſſins, <hi>That it was not a ſingular action of his, upon that offence only; but that formerly, and after in the whole courſe of his Life, he never procured any Revenge, although the injuries were never ſo great. And the moſt that was ever heard to come out of his Mouth, with reſpect to his Wrongs, though moſt inſufferable; was to ſay ſometimes, with a ſerene Countenance,</hi> Videat Dominus &amp; requirat.</p>
                  <p>Nor did he think it enough, not to return the evil, but ſo great was his Charity, that it put him upon doing Good, as he had opportunity, to his implacable Enemies. <hi>He was</hi>
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:48724:21"/> 
                     <hi>no leſs zealous after the Stabbs given him, than he had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in defending the lawful Rights of thoſe, to whom he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted that Villainous Act</hi>

To conclude this particular: What ſhew of probability is there, That the Frier <hi>ſhould compile this Hiſtory, out of Spite and Revenge, for the Wound given him, and the Snares laid for him by the Pope?</hi> when 'tis certain, That he had undertaken this work many Years before, (and perhaps by that time finiſh'd it), it being not the Product of a ſuddain Paſſion, but, as <hi>Pallavicino</hi> confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>the Work of almoſt his whole Life</hi>

                  <p>By what hath been ſaid, is manifeſt; as his Charity for his Enemies, ſo his Piety toward God too: That he had a value for his Religion, more than for his Life; was ſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of its Reputation, that in compariſon he neglected his own.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Though this alone is enough to clear him, from the black charge of Impiety and Hypocriſie, that <hi>Pallavicino</hi> prefers againſt him; yet becauſe the Jeſuit pretends to prove what he ſays, I ſhall briefly conſider the proof he produces. The Charge in brief is; <hi>That he did not believe the Faith he profeſs'd, but was a Catholick in pretence only, an Heretick in truth</hi>

                  <p>But ſuppoſe the Father had thought the Pope to be An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, can any conſidering Man believe, that he would have declared it to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ambaſſador?

                  <p>But now for once, to gratifie the Cardinal, let us grant, That, in his notion of Hereſie, Father <hi>Paul</hi> was an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick; For he did not believe, that the Pope is above a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, or that he hath power to depoſe Princes. He did not believe him to be an infallible Dictator, and that (in caſe he err) Men are bound to own his Errors for Truths: And ſuch Hereticks, I think, we may reckon <hi>Gerſon, Eſpenſaeus, Richerius,</hi> and the generality of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church. But to proceed:</p>
                  <p n="5">5. There cannot be a more undoubted Argument of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity in an Hiſtorian, than Impartiality; and this is in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things ſo viſible in Father <hi>Paul</hi>'s Hiſtory, that he muſt ſhut his Eyes cloſe, who does not diſcern it. <hi>Pallavicino,</hi> 'tis true, frequently repreſents him, as a Man of ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity againſt the Popes, the Preſidents of the Council, and the Catholicks (as they call themſelves) in the general, as prompted him always to defame them. But this is a wilful miſrepreſentation. He was as ready to ſpeak good, where there was ground for it, as evil of them; He relates thoſe things that make for their Credit, as well as their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace; and ſets their Virtues in as clear a light as he does their Vices. I ſhall give ſome Inſtances relating to the Popes and Preſidents of the Council.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To begin with the Popes. He ſays of <hi>Leo</hi> X. <hi>That he was careleſs in things that concern'd Religion and Piety.</hi>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:48724:24"/> But does he not alſo ſay, That <hi>he adorned the Papacy with many good parts which he brought into it, amongſt which were his ſingular learning in Humanity, Goodneſs, and a marvellous ſweet manner in treating of affairs, with a pleaſing beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour more than humane, joyned with incomparable Liberality, and a great inclination to favour thoſe that were Learned, and endowed with any extraordinary Quality. Which Vertues were not found in that See of a long time before, neither equal, nor near unto his</hi>

                        <hi>P.</hi> 4.</note>. He tells us, <hi>That</hi> Clement VII. <hi>was a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard, and mounted to the Popedom by Simony, and lays open thoſe Artifices by which he eluded the calling of a general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil:</hi> But when he gives us his Character, he alſo acquaints us with his Virtues, (ſuch as they were) <hi>He died,</hi> ſays he, <hi>with no ſmall joy of the Court. For though they admired his Virtues, which were a natural Gravity, exemplary Parſimony, and Diſſimulation; yet they hated more his Avarice, Rigidity and Cruelty</hi> 
                     <note n="z" place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 71.</note>. Of <hi>Paul</hi> III. he ſays, That <hi>he was a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late endowed with good Qualities, and among all his Virtues, he made more eſteem of none than of Diſſimulation</hi>

But is it not commendable, that he made choice of Cardinal <hi>Pool,</hi> for his Legat into <hi>England, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that becauſe he was of the Blood Royal, and of an exemplary Life, he would be the fitteſt Inſtrument to reduce that Kingdom to the Church of</hi> Rome <note n="c" place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>p.</hi> 384.</note>? He repreſents <hi>Paul</hi> IV. <hi>as a paſſionate, proud, domineering Huff:</hi> But he withal mentions <hi>the ſeverity of his manners, in the foregoing part of his life, and his endeavours after he came to the Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to reform the Court.</hi> In like manner he treats <hi>Pius</hi> IV. In a word, thoſe Popes who were moſt infamous for their Vices, he finds ſomething to ſay of them, that is laudable.</p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:48724:25"/>
                  <p> But then, what ſays he of <hi>Adrian</hi> VI? Oh! he was a Man too good for this World: <hi>For the Court</hi> (ſays he) <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not worthy of ſuch a Pope, it pleaſed God to call him</hi>

What ſays he of <hi>Marcellus</hi> II? <hi>He was a Man grave and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere by nature, and of a conſtant mind, that ſhew'd the World that his Dignity had not changed him; He thought it neceſſary to make an entire Reformation, and that it would be no loſs to the Papacy, to cut off its Pomps and Vanities, but would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and inlarge it</hi>

                  <p>Now is not this to write impartially? Had he hated the Popes, and not their Vices only, he would have ſpoken ill of one, as well as another. Had he been ſuch a Momus to the Popes, as <hi>Pallavicino</hi> reports him, <note n="f" place="margin">Lynceus ille Romanorum Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificum Momus. <hi>l.</hi> 14. <hi>c.</hi> 1. <hi>n.</hi> 6.</note> he could have ſeen nothing in many of them, beſides their Vices: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the truth is, if he was partial, it was rather in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. For though indeed the Pictures he hath left of ſome of them, are ugly enough; yet they are ſo much more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, as drawn by others (who yet were no Hereticks) that his when compared with theirs, may be thought to flatter them. Yea, I appeal to any indifferent Reader, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Pallavicino</hi> himſelf ſays not more to the diſcredit of <hi>Leo</hi> X. <note n="g" place="margin">Hiſt. <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 2.</note>.

                        <hi>P.</hi> 215.</note>. And truly ſays he, <hi>concerning theſe particulars, it is not fit to rob the Cardinal of his due Praiſe</hi>

                        <hi>P.</hi> 204.</note>. This may perhaps paſs for a Defamation with <hi>Pallavicino,</hi> the Jeſuits being ſo excellent at the art of diſſembling.

                  <p>The Preſidents of the Council under <hi>Julius</hi> III. were <hi>Marcellus Creſcentius,</hi> Cardinal of <hi>S. Marcellus; Sebaſtianus Pighinus,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Siponto;</hi> and <hi>Aloiſius Lipomannus</hi>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:48724:27"/> Biſhop of <hi>Verona;</hi> the firſt in the capacity of <hi>Legat,</hi> the two laſt as <hi>Nuncii,</hi> but of equal authority with the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat.

Upon <hi>Marcellus,</hi> becauſe <hi>among all the Cardinals, he found none more truſty, and withall more worthy:</hi> upon the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Siponto,</hi> for that great confidence he had in him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Papacy: upon the Biſhop of <hi>Verona, for the form of his great Piety, Loyalty and goodneſs</hi>

That <hi>Marcellus</hi> was a <hi>zealous, wiſe, and learned Cardinal;</hi> That the Biſhops of <hi>Siponto</hi> and <hi>Verona, were famous for Knowledge and Experience.</hi> And if we read the Exhortation, which <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Paul</hi> tells us, thoſe Preſidents gave to the Fathers of the Council, in the firſt Seſſion under <hi>Julius,</hi> I can hardly imagine, that there is any Man in the World, but a Jeſuit, who will not think, that the Father intended it for their Commendation; and that there is ſomething in it, which really deſerves it, particularly the Concluſion, that <hi>they ſhould handle the matters of the Council with all Gentleneſs, and without Contention, as becometh ſo great an Aſſembly, uſing perfect Charity, and conſent of minds, knowing that God doth behold and judge them</hi>

                  <p>Of the Legats and Preſidents under <hi>Pius</hi> the <hi>4th,</hi> I ſhall take notice of three only, <hi>viz. Gonzaga</hi> Cardinal of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Seripando,</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Morone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mantua, Soave</hi> tells us, <hi>was a man eminent, not only in regard of the greatneſs of his Houſe, and of his Brother</hi> Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randus, <hi>but for his own Virtue</hi>

                        <hi>L.</hi> 5. <hi>p.</hi> 444.</note>. And one great inſtance of his Virtue, is the freedom <hi>(Soave</hi> tells us) he us'd to the Pope: For <hi>he wrote to him with his own hand, that he had not a face to appear any more in Congregation, to give words only, as he had done two years together; That all the Miniſters of Princes do ſay, that howſoever his Holineſs</hi>
                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:48724:27"/> 
                     <hi>doth promiſe much for Reformation, yet ſeeing nothing to be executed, they do not think, that he hath any inclination to it</hi>

                        <hi>L.</hi> 7. <hi>p.</hi> 675.</note>.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seripando,</hi> he ſays, was <hi>a Divine of much fame</hi> 
                     <note n="f" place="margin">
                        <hi>L.</hi> 5. <hi>p.</hi> 445.</note>. That when he came to be prime Legat, upon the death of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua,</hi> he wrote to the Pope, That <hi>he would be glad his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs would ſend another Legat, his Superiour, to govern the Council, or remove him; But in caſe he would leave him prime Legat, he told him, he would proceed as God ſhould inſpire him; and that otherwiſe it were better to remove him abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely</hi> 
                     <note n="g" place="margin">
                        <hi>L.</hi> 7. <hi>p.</hi> 678.</note>. But that which eſpecially commends this Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, is the account <hi>Soave</hi> gives of his death. <hi>He died,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to the great grief of all the Prelats, and of all</hi> Trent, <hi>having in the morning received the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, which he took out of his Bed upon his Knees. After that he return'd to his Bed, and in the preſence of five Prelats,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>he confeſs'd his Faith, wholly conformable to the Catholick of the Roman Church, ſpake of the works of a Chriſtian, of the Reſurrection of the Dead, of the Council, recommending the progreſs of it to the Legats,</hi> &amp;c. <note n="h" place="margin">
                        <hi>L.</hi> 7. <hi>p.</hi> 687.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Among many things related of Cardinal <hi>Morone</hi> to his Praiſe, I ſhall mention only ſome paſſages of that Speech, which he made upon his firſt coming to <hi>Trent.</hi> He told the Fathers, That <hi>the Wars, Seditions, and other Calamities pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and imminent for our ſins, would ceaſe, if a means were found to appeaſe God, and to reſtore the ancient Purity. That he brought with him two Things; one a good Meaning of the Pope, to ſecure the Doctrine of Faith, to correct bad Manners,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the other, his own readineſs to do what the Pope had commanded him. He pray'd the Fathers that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and Diſcord, and unprofitable Queſtions being laid aſide, which do grievouſly offend Chriſtendom, they would ſeriouſly handle the things which were neceſſary</hi> 
                     <note n="i" place="margin">
                        <hi>L.</hi> 7. <hi>p.</hi> 697.</note>. Is there any thing in
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48724:28"/> this, that <hi>Pallavicino</hi> can interpret to the diſcredit of <hi>Morone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I think I have now prov'd, what I undertook as to the Popes and Preſidents of the Council; which was not, that <hi>Soave</hi> never ſays any thing to their diſpraiſe, but that he ſometimes ſays thoſe things which are for their Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; which is a plain Confutation of <hi>Pallavicino</hi>'s Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny, and an irrefragable argument of Father <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity. And if the Jeſuit ſo ſhamefully forges in matters ſo obvious, what credit is to be given to him in other things, in which the Falſity is not ſo eaſily detected? Having ſaid more than enough for the clearing of the firſt thing propoſed, I proceed to the ſecond, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>

Thoſe are eſpecially the two Jeſuits before named, <hi>viz. Scipio Henricus,</hi> and <hi>Sfortia Pallavicino. Scipio Henry</hi>'s Book is divided into two parts. In the firſt he hath extracted out of <hi>Soave</hi>'s Hiſtory, what he thought was good, and advantageous to the Catholick Religion; and this he hath digeſted into an Hiſtory of the Council. In the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond (which is divided into five Sections) he hath gather'd together the Tares (as he calls them) and bound them up in Bundles to be burnt <note n="(k)" place="margin">Et ſane admirabile eſt qua ratione in opere hoc vera cum falſis admixta ſint: &amp; ex bonis &amp; pro Catholica Religione utilibus Haereticorum deliramenta orian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.

Now theſe, which are the principal things, he ſuppoſes may be all true, (though he ſays indeed, that he will not vouch for the Truth of them) <note n="†" place="margin">Praeterea eſt advertendum, quod ea, quae ex illo volumine extracta in Hiſtoriam a me rediguntur, non protinus ut vera &amp; approbata amplectenda eſſe: ſed ut quae in illo opere inventa; &amp; poſſibiſia fuiſſe non repugnet.

Yea, in the paſſage before quoted, he calls theſe, <hi>the Wheat of Catholick Truth, which is to be laid up in Chriſt's Granary:</hi> And if it be granted, that theſe are truly reported by <hi>Soave;</hi> there will be little reaſon to ſuſpect, that other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of leſs moment are forged.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the ſecond Part, he further builds up what he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to pull down, becauſe thoſe things in <hi>Soave</hi>'s Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which he ſays are Lyes. Firſt, ſome of them in caſe they are ſo, are Lyes of his own forging. Secondly others, the Reaſons he gives are of no force to prove them ſo. Thirdly, Others are ſuch things which an unprejudiced per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will be ſo far from looking upon as Lyes, that he will be thereby the more enclined, to believe all the reſt <hi>Father Paul</hi> ſays to be true.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Some of them are Lyes of his own making, by miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting <hi>Soave</hi>'s Words. For inſtance, <hi>The Hiſtorian,</hi> ſays <hi>Henry, lyes, in ſaying, that the Fathers themſelves were not Divines; for ſince in every Seſſion they had Sermons, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſome of them were Divines</hi>

As he here abuſes <hi>Soave,</hi> by taking from his words, ſo in other places by adding to them. As when he makes him ſay, That the Aſſertions of <hi>Luther</hi> were condemn'd by Courtiers that were <hi>unlearned and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful, and not fit for matters of ſo great weight</hi>

The words, <hi>unlearned,</hi> &amp;c. are foiſted in by himſelf, to furniſh out matters for a Lye.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Other matters which he ſays are Lyes, the Reaſons he gives are of no force to prove them to be ſo. For inſtance, 'Tis falſe, ſays he, that the common opinion of the Divines was, that this Article <hi>[Men are not bound to communicate at Eaſter]</hi> ought not to be condemn'd for Heretical. Why? Becauſe it was afterward condemn'd by the Council <note n="(†)" place="margin">Sect. 2.

                  <p>'Tis true, that <hi>Aquinas</hi> in the place quoted by <hi>Henry,</hi> aſſerts the contrary Doctrine out of S. <hi>Auſtin:</hi> But nothing can be truer, than that <hi>Aquinas</hi> either ignorantly or wilfully abuſes the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by perverting firſt his words in changing <hi>cogitatis</hi> into <hi>cogitetis,</hi> (for ſo it is in <hi>Aquinas,)</hi> and then wreſting them to a ſenſe directly contrary to S. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s meaning; for thoſe very words are uſed by him, to prove that little Children cannot be ſav'd, without receiving the Body and Blood of Chriſt, as will be evident to any Man, who will be at the pains to conſult the context.

                        <hi>L.</hi> 23. <hi>c.</hi> 1.</note>. As if thoſe Records which he had ſeen, muſt of neceſſity contain whatſoever was done or ſpoken in, or concerning the Council; As if <hi>Soave</hi> might not know many things concerning the Council,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:48724:32"/> which he could not be inform'd of, who was fifty Years more diſtant; As if he could not have thoſe informations from Men who were Eye and Ear-witneſſes of all that paſſed, which <hi>Palla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicino</hi> could by no means attain to, after thoſe Perſons were gone into the other World.</p>
                  <p>When two Perſons write of the ſame ſubject, is it a good Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that whatſoever is ſaid by one of them is falſe, if it be not alſo reported by the other? S. <hi>Matthew</hi> and S. <hi>Mark</hi> have both written the Life of our Bleſſed Saviour, may we not as reaſonably conclude, that many things delivered by S. <hi>Matthew</hi> are falſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not to be met with in S. <hi>Mark?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. He miſreports many things delivered by <hi>Soave,</hi> and then cries a Lye, when he himſelf hath made it. He tells us <hi>Soave</hi> ſays, That the words of the Pope's Bull for recalling the Council to <hi>Trent,</hi> were ſuch which <hi>plainly expreſſed the continuation of the Trent-Council</hi> 
                     <note n="h" place="margin">—Che apertamente eſprimevano di continuare il Concilio in Trento. <hi>l.</hi> 11. <hi>c.</hi> 11. <hi>n.</hi> 4.</note>.

                        </gap>iaſſumerlo &amp; proſeguirlo.</note>. In the next Paragraph, ſpeaking of a Decree made in the Diet, he leaves out the moſt material paſſages, and thoſe which alone were pertinent to the matter in hand, and then repreſents <hi>Soave</hi> as contradicting himſelf. If the Reader pleaſe to conſult the place, and compare it with <hi>Soave,</hi> he will no doubt be ſurpriz'd, if the commonneſs of Miſrepreſentations, from the Men of his Society, do not make the wonder ceaſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Errors he charges <hi>Soave</hi> with, are for the greater part in matters of no moment. Of that pompous Catalogue of 360, more than 200, ſays <hi>Amelot,</hi> are ſo ſlight, that they are not worth the labour of mentioning <note n="k" place="margin">Quant aux 361. fautes, ou fauſſetés, que le Cardinal refute, il y en a plus de 200. qui ſont ſi legéres, qu'elles ne valoient pas la peine d'en parler.</note>. What matters it, whether a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation was held the next day after the Seſſion, or the next but one? Whether a Seſſion was appointed on the 9th of <hi>October,</hi> or
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48724:32"/> on the 11th? Whether the King of <hi>France</hi> died the 21ſt or the 31ſt of <hi>March?</hi> Whether ſuch a Man came to <hi>Trent</hi> the 14th, or the 24th of <hi>Auguſt?</hi> Whether <hi>Martinuccio</hi> were a Monk of the Order of S. <hi>Baſil,</hi> or of S. <hi>Paul</hi> the Hermite? Are theſe things, whether ſo or ſo, any thing to the main buſineſs? What Hiſtories can be juſtified, if a miſtake in things of this nature is ſufficient to condemn them? Since none can be found, which do not as much differ one from another in ſuch Circumſtantials, as Father <hi>Paul</hi>'s does from the <hi>Vatican</hi> Records. Yea may not the Cardinal by the ſame way of reaſoning conclude, that no Credit is to be given to S. <hi>Luke</hi>'s Hiſtory of the firſt Council at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſince Perſons that have written about it, contradict one another in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as conſiderable, as thoſe before-mentioned?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. His own Errors are as numerous, as thoſe he pretends in <hi>Soave. I could,</hi> ſays <hi>Amelot, eaſily find as great a number of faults in his Hiſtrry, as that is either of real or pretended Faults, which he hath reckon'd in Frier</hi> Pauls <note n="*" place="margin">Car je pourois bien en trouver un auſſi. grand nombre que celui des fautes, vraies ou pretendues, qu'il compte dans l'Hiſtoire de Frà Paolo.</note>. Nor are his Errors only as nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, but many of them ſuch, which it can hardly be ſuppoſed, but he himſelf muſt know to be Errors. He tells us, <hi>That</hi> Luther <hi>and</hi> Sleidan <hi>convince</hi> Soave <hi>of a Lye, in aſcribing the riſe of Hereſie</hi> (ſo he calls <hi>Luther</hi>'s Doctrine) <hi>to the abuſes in ſelling Indulgences</hi>

                        <hi>L.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 3, <hi>n.</hi> 5.</note>. What <hi>Luther</hi> ſays of this matter, I know not; but whoſoever will be at the pains to read the firſt and ſecond Pages in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries, he will plainly ſee, that <hi>Sleidan</hi> ſays the very ſame things concerning it that <hi>Soave</hi> does.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Were <hi>Soave</hi>'s Hiſtory entirely, in every tittle, true, it would nevertheleſs have appeared falſe to <hi>Pallavicino,</hi> whoſe ſight was ſo enormouſly vitiated, by the overflowings of his Gall.

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48724:33"/> and ſo is that Man, who is reſolv'd to contradict; <hi>who needs no more to make him ſpeak ill of a Man</hi> (as a <hi>Romaniſt</hi> obſerves of <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lavicino) than that Father</hi> Paul <hi>ſpeak well of him, as if he thought it better to renounce common ſenſe, than not to oppoſe his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary:</hi> who as if he had loſt his diſcerning faculty, falls foul up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all he meets with, right or wrong; and rails at as triumphant a rate, againſt thoſe Errors, which if ſuch, are very harmleſs ones, as againſt thoſe that are moſt pernicious <note n="(l)" place="margin">Iſte vero ſummo livore imbutus, omnia ut peſſima reprchendit ac promiſcue ſive bonu ſive mala verborum profluvio involvit, atque ut falſa ſuadere nititur.

                  <p n="6">6. Such are <hi>Pallavicino</hi>'s Proofs as render his whole work ſuſpected.

That they are ſo indeed, he expects we ſhould believe upon his bare word, which yet will not paſs for much, among many Men of his own Church. But ſuppoſe they are, is it a thing granted, that all is true, that is in the <hi>Vatican</hi> Manuſcripts?</p>
                  <p>He frequently quotes the Acts of the Council; the <hi>Vatican,</hi> it ſeems, is furniſhed with plenty of them; the Acts of <hi>Paleottus,</hi> of <hi>Menſottus,</hi> of the Biſhop of <hi>Salamanca,</hi> &amp;c. O how thankful would many Men be to his Holineſs, would he bleſs the World with the ſight of theſe! Yea, what would they not willingly give to purchaſe them? If then they are ſuch as will abide the Teſt, why are they ſtill kept under Lock and Key? Is it not to be ſuſpected, that the Wares are adulterate, when the Merchant will not be perſuaded to bring them into the Light? Is the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> ſo ſelf-denying, as not to publiſh thoſe things, which make for their advantage? May we not then conclude, That either they are ſuch as will not endure the Trial; or in caſe they will, that beſides what makes for them, they contain thoſe matters alſo, which make more againſt them?</p>
                  <p>Beſides, It is a thing known to the World, that the Legats in the Council, had two ſorts of Inſtructions: one Letter was to be
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48724:33"/> ſhew'd to give ſatisfaction to the Biſhops and Ambaſſadors; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ran counter to it, and was to be concealed: And may we not ſuppoſe, that thoſe Letters which the Cardinal ſo frequently cites, were of that ſort only which were to be communicated, which were direct contrary to thoſe that were concealed? What credit then is to be given to his Proofs?</p>
                  <p>For theſe, and many other Reaſons (which to avoid tediouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs I omit) the Cardinals Counter-Hiſtory, hath not met with that eſteem among learned Men of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as was expected; and inſtead of blaſting the Reputation of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Paul</hi>'s Hiſtory, hath made it to be more highly valu'd by many Men, than it was before.</p>

               <head>CHAP. III. <hi>The Vanity of the pretended Reformation of the Council of</hi> TRENT.</head>
               <p>HAving given Father <hi>Paul</hi> his due, I ſhall now proceed to treat of the Reformation made by the Council.</p>
               <p>I might premiſe ſeveral general Conſiderations, by which all impartial Perſons will be abundantly ſatisfied, that no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation to purpoſe could be made by it: <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Pope and his Court, were very averſe from ſuch a Reformation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Pope by his Legats, preſided in the Council.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The propoſal of all matters to be treated of, was reſerved to the Legats.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Legats in doubtful matters confulted the Pope, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they propoſed them to be diſcuſs'd.</p>
               <p n="5">5. After matters had been diſcuſs'd in the Congregations,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48724:34"/> before they were propoſed in the Seſſion, the Legats ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> to know the Pope's Pleaſure.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Biſhops of the Council, were generally ſuch as were addicted to the Pope; either as they were <hi>Italians,</hi> or as they were his Penſioners, or both: And therefore ſuch as would not contradict him, except in ſuch rare Caſes, in which the Pope's Intereſt, and their own could not be reconciled; ſuch as the Exemption of Regulars, and the Divine Right of Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy.</p>
               <p n="7">7. When any conſiderable oppoſition was like to be made, all Arts were uſed, the moſt diſingenuous not excepted, to bring over the Diſſenters to the Pope's Party.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Nothing was propoſed in the later Seſſions to be defined, till they were before ſecure of a Party, to carry it that way which the Pope deſired. He that conſiders theſe things, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expect any good from this Council.</p>
               <p>But paſſing over all theſe, I ſhall at preſent conſider matter of Fact only, what was done, and what was not done, by the Council, which ſhall be reduc'd to theſe three general Heads:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>That in thoſe matters in which a Reformation was moſt neceſſary, not the leaſt Reformation was made, or ſo much as pretended.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>That in thoſe matters, in which a mighty Reformation was pretended, little or rather none was really made.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. <hi>That inſtead of Reformation, the Council produc'd a greater Deformation; what it found bad, it left in many reſpects worſe.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <div n="1" type="section">
                  <head>SECT. I. <hi>In thoſe matters in which a Reformation was moſt neceſſary, not the leaſt Reformation was made, or ſo much as pretended.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That in thoſe matters in which Reformation was moſt neceſſary, not the leaſt Reformation was made, or ſo much as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</hi>
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:48724:34"/> And theſe things were of two ſorts; matters of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and matters of Worſhip. In which, I ſay, Reformation was moſt neceſſary, becauſe Errors in theſe, are of the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous conſequence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Errors in Doctrine were numerous, and many of them in points of the higheſt moment, I have already ſhew'd <note n="(a)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Part.</hi> 1.</note>, and therefore ſhall ſpare the labour of men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning them here. That the Proteſtants with one Mind and one Mouth demanded a Reformation of theſe eſpecially, as abſolutely neceſſary, I need not prove, it being a thing noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to all Men, who have read but ſo much as the <hi>Ausburg</hi> Confeſſion. Yea, That many Errors in Doctrine were ſo groſs, that thoſe very <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> who (in compliance with their worldly Intereſt) reſolv'd not to reform them, were not able to ſhut their Eyes ſo cloſe, as not to diſcern them, we may conclude, from that Counſel which the Biſhops aſſembled at <hi>Bononia,</hi> gave to Pope <hi>Julius</hi> III. for the eſtabliſhment of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, <hi>viz. The</hi> Lutherans <hi>receive and confeſs all the Articles of the</hi> Athanaſian, Nicene, <hi>and Apoſtles Creed. The ſame</hi> Lutherans <hi>refuſe to admit any Doctrine, except that only which hath the Prophets, Chriſt, and his Apoſtles for its Authors, and wiſh that we would imitate the ancient Churches, and not think of receiving any Traditions, which it is not more manifeſt than the Noon-day light, were dictated and inſtituted by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the Apoſtles. But we, on the contrary, following the opinion of your Holineſs, will have all Traditions, Conſtitutions, Rules, and Ceremonies, which have heretofore, either by the Fathers, or Councils, or even by any private Man (with a good Zeal) been intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd into the Church, to be believ'd, and accounted neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. And particularly, as to Tradition, we intirely believe and confeſs, as a true Article of Faith, That which the Council of</hi> Trent <hi>hath determin'd in the Decree of the third Seſſion. And although we cannot prove this (for we plainly confeſs between our ſelves, that we cannot prove, that which we hold and teach con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning</hi>
                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:48724:35"/> 
                     <hi>Tradition) yet we confeſs it to be true, becauſe the</hi> Roman <hi>Church holds it.—But that we may confeſs the Truth (which muſt be kept as a ſecret) in the time of the Apoſtles, and for ſome Years after the Apoſtles, there was no mention of the Papacy, or the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalſhip; much leſs were there theſe Doctrines, theſe Laws, theſe Cuſtoms, no, nor the Empire over the Nations, that we now obtain: But all Miniſters of all Churches (of the</hi> Roman <hi>no leſs than of others) did voluntarily obey Kings, and Princes, and Magiſtrates</hi> 
                     <note n="b" place="margin">Lutherani Symboli Apoſtolorum, Nicaeni &amp; Athanaſii Articulos omnes recipiunt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Conſil. de ſtabiliend. Rom. Eccleſ. Vergerii Tom. 1. <hi>p.</hi> 95, 96.</note>. And a little after, he proceeds thus: <hi>Certainly we ſcarce retain in our Churches, ſo much as a ſhadow of the Doctrine and Diſcipline, which flouriſh'd in the times of the Apoſtles, but have brought in another quite different from it</hi> 
                     <note n="c" place="margin">Certe vix um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bram quandam retinemus in noſtris Eccleſiis ejus doctrinae &amp; diſciplinae quae Apoſtolorum temporibus floruerunt, &amp; prorſus aliam accerſivimus. <hi>p.</hi> 97.</note>. <hi>And in the concluſion, they give the Pope this Counſel, as the moſt weighty of all. That he labour with all his might, that as little as poſſible of the Goſpel (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the vulgar Tongue) may be read in the Cities, that are under his Dominion; that that very little, which is wont to be read in the Maſs, may be ſufficient, and that no mortal Man may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to read more of it. For as long, ſay they, as Men were contented with that little, your affairs ſucceeded according to your wiſh, which began to decline to the contrary, as ſoon as Men took upon them to read more. In brief this is the Book, which hath raiſed the Tempeſts and Storms with which we are toſs'd. And the truth is, if any Man ſhall diligently conſider that Book, and ſhall take a view of thoſe things which are done in our Churches; he will ſee, that there is a vaſt diſagreement between them; and that our Doctrine, is not only altogether different from that, but which is more, is often contrary to it</hi>

                  <p> This was the Confeſſion of Popiſh Biſhops, but made in the Pope's Ear, and afterward divulged to the World, by a great Biſhop of that Church, who a little before was ſo zealous an Advocate for the Romiſh Faith, and ſo much the Popes Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorite, that he made choice of him before all others, for his Legate, to reduce the Hereticks in <hi>Germany.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Forty years before this, the Cardinals and Biſhops in the Council of <hi>Piſa,</hi> not only confeſs'd their Errors in Doctrine, but decreed a Reformation in Faith, as well as in Manners <note n="e" place="margin">Seſſ. 3. Richer. Hiſt. Concil. general. <hi>l.</hi> 4. parte 1. <hi>p.</hi> 430.</note>. For though (as I ſaid before) that Decree was made by them to ſerve a Deſign; yet the ſerving of that Deſign, was a plain Demonſtration that ſuch a Reformation was judged needful by many of the Roman Church. Add to theſe the Emperor, the King of <hi>France</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> who demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch a Reformation from the Trent-Council, as was in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny points plainly repugnant to the received Doctrines of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church <note n="f" place="margin">Natalis Comes <hi>l.</hi> 14.

                  <p>And was any thing done by the Council in compliance with theſe Confeſſions and Demands? No, not one of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, was ſo much as reflected upon, much leſs condemn'd. Yea, ſo far was the Council from making any alteration in Doctrine, that the Emperour with all his Authority, could not obtain leave for the Proteſtants, ſo much as to propoſe their Doctrine <note n="g" place="margin">Soave <hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 359. 360. Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerii Secret. Pontif. Actio 1.</note>.</p>
                  <p>And to make all ſure, againſt any ſuch kind of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the Pope provided, that his moſt learned Prelats might not come acquainted with any other Doctrine, than what their Mother (the Church) had taught them: For he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited not only the Biſhops, but the Cardinals too, to look into the Books of the <hi>Lutherans</hi> 
                     <note n="h" place="margin">Verger. ſecret. Pontif. Act. 3. <hi>p.</hi> 77, 78, 82, 83.</note>. And were not they, think you, likely to be equal Judges, who were to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48724:36"/> thoſe Doctrines, which they were not permitted to examine?</p>
                  <p>But 'tis needleſs to ſhew that no Reformation was made in Doctrine, ſince <hi>R. H.</hi> confeſſes, That the <hi>Tridentine</hi> Fathers were unanimous in condemning the Proteſtant Tenets <note n="i" place="margin">
                        <hi>Conſiderat. on the Counc. of</hi> Trent. <hi>ſ.</hi> 150.</note>. And that the Pope had no need of the <hi>Italian</hi> Biſhops to that purpoſe, becauſe the whole Council did concurr in condemning them <note n="k" place="margin">
                        <hi>S.</hi> 167.</note>. Nor did the Fathers ſo much as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to any ſuch Reformation, the very notion of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being by them limited to ſo narrow a compaſs, as not to reach it: Nor could they extend it further, without quitting their claim to Infallibility.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Nor was any the leaſt Reformation made in matters of Divine Worſhip; No, not ſo much as in the Language in which it was celebrated, though earneſtly deſired by the Emperor, the King of <hi>France,</hi> the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Bavaria, &amp;c.</hi> But notwithſtanding the importunity of theſe great Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Princes, back'd with the moſt perſuaſive Arguments, in plain contradiction to Scripture, and to the Practice of the ancient Church; in defiance to Reaſon and the common ſenſe of Mankind, the Church-ſervice was ſtill continued in a Language not underſtood by thoſe that heard it; No, nor many times, by thoſe that read it; and an Anathema de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd againſt thoſe who ſhall dare to ſay, that <hi>Maſs ought to be celebrated in the vulgar Tongue</hi>

And could it be expected, that they ſhould reform any Abuſe in the Object or matter of their Worſhip, who would not remove that, which defeats its very end, and makes it inſtead of a <hi>reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> a <hi>brutiſh</hi> Service? eſpecially conſidering, that it might (as one would think) have been done, without the leaſt detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to any of their worldly Intereſts.</p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:48724:36"/>
                  <p> I know that <hi>R. H.</hi> in his Catalogue of thoſe Grievances, which, he ſays, the <hi>Council took into conſideration, and rectifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what they judg'd amiſs, ſo far as that iron Age would permit</hi>

That the Council took this into Conſideration is granted, but 'tis certain they did not rectifie it, and therefore (it ſeems) judged nothing amiſs in it; for had they done ſo, the obſtinacy of the Age, could not have hindred them from rectifying it: for that <hi>Iron Age,</hi> how ſtubborn ſoever in other matters; as to this piece of Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was ſo flexible, that (excepting the <hi>Spaniards)</hi> it generally inclined to it. And yet after all the conſideration the Council had about it, they at length determined, not to determine it, but to refer it intirely to the Popes Judgment <note n="n" place="margin">Hoc decreto Sancta Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodus refert ad Pontificem Max. ſententiam &amp; judicium integrum illorum duorum Articulorum, quos antea propoſitos nondum diſcuſſcrat: nimirum, an Conſuetudo Catholicae Eccleſiae communicandi Laicos, &amp; non conficientes Sacerdotes, ſub una tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ſpecie panis, ita ſit retinenda, ut nulla ratione Calicis uſus, cuiqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thus we have ſeen, that no Reformation at all was made, in thoſe matters, in which a Reformation was moſt neceſſary, and which in compariſon were the only things the Proteſtants demanded a Reformation of. For though indeed they made great complaints, of Corruptions in Manners and Diſcipline, yet they withal profeſs'd, that they did not look upon theſe, as ſufficient ground, to break with the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> But that their Errors in Faith; their Sacriledge, Superſtition and Idolatry in Worſhip, were the only Grievances that were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable; without the redreſs of which, there was no remedy, but they muſt forſake her Communion.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. The Perſons who were exempted. To talk of reforming, and not to correct him, or them in whom the Deformity has its riſe, and from whom it deſcends to others, is as abſurd, as to talk of curing a Diſeaſe, without removing its prime cauſe; which no Phyſician will pretend to, who is not either a Knave or a Fool.

For the proof of this (paſſing over many others as needleſs) I ſhall content my ſelf to produce two wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, whoſe Authority is beyond Exception. The firſt is the Select Council of Cardinals and other Prelates, Deputed by <hi>Paul</hi> III. to acquaint him with the abuſes, and what were the beſt expedients by which they might be reform'd; who preſented to him upon Oath, <hi>That the Original of the evils the Church groan'd under was, that ſome Popes (his Predeceſſors) having itching ears, had heapt up to themſelves Teachers after their own luſts; not ſuch from whom they might learn what they ought to do, but ſuch by whoſe art and cunning they might find out a way to make what they liſted, Lawful; ſo that the will of the Pope, (whatſoever it was) might be the rule by which his actions were to be directed.

                  <p>Firſt, Several of thoſe Abuſes it took notice of, it referr'd the Reformation of them to the Pope.

We have likewiſe ſeen, that the withholding of the Cup, was remitted entirely to his Judgment. To which I add the abuſes of Indulgences (which had given infinite Scandal, and were a chief motive to the Reformation); The <hi>Synod</hi> deſiring, that theſe might be corrected, ordains in the general: <hi>That all wicked gains for the obtaining of them, be utterly aboliſhd. But for other Abuſes, which proceed from Superſtition, Ignorance, Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverence, or other occaſions whatſoever, ſeeing by reaſon of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold Corruptions of Places and Provinces in which they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, they cannot be prohibited in particular, It commands all Biſhops, that every one of them diligently collect the Abuſes of his own Church, and propoſe them in the firſt Provincial Synod; to the end, that being known by the other Biſhops alſo, they may forthwith be preſented to the Pope, by whoſe Authority and Prudence, that may be determin'd which is expedient for the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church</hi>

For Cauſes were never taken from the lawful Tribunals, but by Commiſſion and Advocation of Popes; and now the cauſe of the Diſeaſe was preſerv'd, and the Symptom only cured. And however the adjunct (for urgent and reaſonable Cauſes) did ſeem to moderate the matter well; yet Men of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding knew, that it was as much as to ſay,</hi> for any Arbitrary Cauſe <note n="(a)" place="margin">Soav. l. 8. p. 792.</note>. And <hi>R. H.</hi> himſelf grants almoſt as much as this amounts to. For in that he ſays, <hi>A Reſcript after the matter is particularly made known to the Pope, and upon this his Hand and Seal obtain'd, cannot be a thing ſo ordinarily happening as to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the whole benefit of the Decree</hi>

                  <p>But what a ridiculous Piece of Mockery was the Explication of the Clauſe, <hi>proponentibus Legatis,</hi> Chap. 21. The Emperor's and the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Ambaſſadours had often declar'd againſt it, (as that which deſtroy'd the Liberty of the Council) and earneſtly demanded, that it might be revoked, but could by no means obtain it; at length, when they were now putting an end to the Council, they declare, <hi>That the meaning of the Synod was, not to change in any part the uſual manner of handling Matters in general Councils:</hi> As if a Phyſician who could not be prevailed with to do any thing for his Patient while there was hope of Life, ſhould ſet himſelf to apply his Medicines juſt when his Patient was dying.</p>
                  <p>By what hath been ſaid, it is ſufficiently manifeſt, That many

                  <p n="4">4. But let us now ſuppoſe, That there had been no fraud in the Decrees themſelves, but that they had been all ſo compoſed, to render them moſt effectual for obtaining their ends; That they had been extended to all Perſons, and to all matters too, that ſtood in need of Reformation: Yet they were all in effect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked (that is, render'd no further binding than the Pope pleas'd) theſe two ways. 1. By reſerving to the Pope a power of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſing with them. 2. By reſerving to him, the whole power of expounding them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By reſerving to the Pope a power diſpenſing with them; For nothing was decreed but with this reſerve, <hi>Saving always the Authority of the Apoſtolick See in all things.</hi> This was expreſly premiſed to the Decrees of Reformation, <hi>Seſſ.</hi> 7. <note n="(c)" place="margin">Eadem Sacraſancta Synodus, eiſdem Praeſidentibus Legatis, incaeptum reſiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia &amp; Reformationis Negotium, ad Dei Laudem &amp; Chriſtianae Religionis increnentum proſequi intendens, ut ſequitur ſtatuendum cenſuit, ſalva ſemper in omnibus ſedis Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicae auctoritate.</note>.

                  <p>I have now ſhewed, that as to thoſe Matters in which alone a Reformation is pretended, 1. That thoſe Perſons were exempted from it, who were the prime Cauſes of the Abuſes. 2. That thoſe Abuſes which the Council did not concern themſelves about, were as to their Number more; as to their Nature and Quality more miſchievous, than thoſe which the Council reflected upon. 3. That thoſe Abuſes the Council took notice of, ſome of them it made no Decrees of Reformation about, but referr'd them wholly to the Pope; Others, the Decrees to reform them, were many of them meer Shams and Illuſions. 4. That ſuppoſing the Council had extended their Decrees to all Perſons, and to all things that ſtood in need of being reformed; that they had ſo framed them, as to render them moſt effectual to the obtaining of their end; yet they in effect revoked them all, both by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:48724:46"/> to the Pope a Power of diſpenſing with them, and by reſerving to him alone the Power of interpreting them. From whence the Concluſion is plainly this, That even in Matters of Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline, and of Manners (which were the only Matters the Council undertook to reform) the Reformation was deluſory; not in Truth and Reality, but in Word and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence only: Which was the thing to be proveed.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. If it were true, that this is the Accuſation of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> only, yet that doth not leſſen its force; becauſe the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> do not deſire to be credited upon their own word, but upon the Authority of the Evidence they produce; they demand belief, not of what they ſay, but of what they prove: As therefore our Bleſſed Saviour ſaid to the unbelieving <hi>Jews: If I do not the work of my Father, believe me not; but if I do, tho' ye believe not me, believe the works</hi> 
                     <note n="(k)" place="margin">Joh. 10. 37, 38.</note>: In like manner may the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> ſay; If we do not ſufficiently prove what we aſſert, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve us not; but if we do, though ye believe not us, yet believe our Proofs. And therefore the Queſtions, Whether the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> be Enemies, or whether they be Friends, are in this Caſe wholly impertinent; becauſe credit is due to the greateſt Enemy in proportion to the proof of what he aſſerts. But, Secondly, That this Accuſation is preferr'd againſt the Council, by <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> only, is not true, but manifeſtly falſe; as will appear by the laſt Argument propos'd for the proof of the Second Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (which will for ever ſilence this Objection).

So many Contradictions as are involved in this, ſo many Falſities at leaſt are contained in it: And thoſe are not a few, ſince nothing is more eaſie than to produce Canons and Definitions of ſuch Councils as the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> will have to be General, which are manifeſtly repugnant (not only to Scripture, but) one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are a few of thoſe many new Definitions made by the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> The greater part of which are moſt pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable Falſhoods: The reſt were not only diſputable points in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> before the Definitions of the Council; but ſome of them are ſtill diſputed, others of them ſtifly denied by learned men of that Church. So that were the Propoſitions true, yet the Articles of Faith are falſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Theſe Propoſitions, the beſt of which are doubtful, the reſt manifeſtly falſe, are made by the Council ſo neceſſary to be believed, that whoſoever does not aſſent to them, is <hi>eo ipſo</hi> branded for an Heretick, and condemned to the portion of Reprobates.</p>
                  <p>This one would think were evident beyond all contradiction, both by the Anathema affixed to every Canon, and by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> IV. at the end of his new Creed, viz. <hi>This is the Catholick Faith, without which no man can be ſaved.</hi> Part of which Catholick Faith, is the belief of all the Decrees and Canons of the <hi>Trent</hi> Council.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>R. H.</hi> ſays, That <hi>all the Canons in the Council that have Anathsma affixed, do not enjoyn aſſent under Anathema to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory Prepoſition, nor make it an Article of Faith neceſſary to be</hi>
                     <pb n="97" facs="tcp:48724:51"/> 
                     <hi>believed under the penalty of being reputed an Heretick</hi> 
                     <note n="e" place="margin">S. 186.</note>. How then ſhall we know which do? For our reſolution, he gives us theſe rules of <hi>Canus. When the Decree, to which ſuch Canen relates, binds to aſſent with a</hi> firma fide Credendum,—hoc eſt dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma fidei Catholicae—Contrarium aſſerentes <hi>(or</hi> tenentes) judicentur pro Haereticis, <hi>or ſome other equivalent expreſſion: Or when the Canon runs,</hi> Siquis hoc ſenſerit, Anathema ſit <note n="f" place="margin">Ibid.</note>. Since he hath referr'd us to <hi>Canus,</hi> let <hi>Canus</hi> be Judge; provided thoſe other words and Rules in <hi>Canus,</hi> which he hath unſaithfully omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, may be ſuppli'd. And</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt Rule <hi>Canus</hi> gives, by which we may know that a Decree is <hi>de ſide,</hi> is this, (which he ſays is manifeſt) <hi>If thoſe who aſſert the contrary, are judged to be Hereticks</hi> 
                     <note n="g" place="margin">Prima, &amp; ea quidem manifeſta, ſi contrarium aſſerentes judicentur pro Haereticis, Locor. Theolog. <hi>l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 5. <hi>qu.</hi> 4.</note>. Now in the cloſe of the Doctrine of Penance, and Extreme Unction, the Synod for ever damns and Anathematizes thoſe, who aſſert the contrary <note n="h" place="margin">Aſſerentes contrarium perpetuo damnat &amp; Anthematizat. <hi>Seſſ.</hi> 14.</note>; that is, judges them to be Hereticks. And in the concluſion of the Doctrine concerning Matrimony, the Synod decrees the following Anathematiſms expreſly againſt Hereticks <note n="i" place="margin">—Hos in ipſos Haereticos, eorumque errores decernens Anathematiſmos.</note>. And therefore by this Rule, the contradictory to every one of thoſe Propoſitions which are anathematiz'd in the Thirteen Canons concerning Penitence, the Four concerning Extream Unction, and the Twelve concerning Matrimony, is an Article of Faith neceſſary to be believed, under the Penalty of being reputed an Heretick: Such for inſtance are theſe,</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>That Penance, Extream <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction, and Matrimony, are truly and properly Sacraments.</l>
                     <l>That no Man can be ſaved who does not confeſs to a Prieſt, thoſe circumſtances of Mortal Sin which change the kind.</l>
                     <l>That Matrimony conſers Grace.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p n="2">2. It is a Decree of Faith, when the Canon runs in this form.
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:48724:52"/> 
                     <hi>If any Man thinks this or that, let him be</hi> accurſed <note n="k" place="margin">Siquis hoc aut illud ſenſerit, Anathema ſit. Canus ubi ſupra.</note>. As by this Rule the far greater part of the Propoſitions defin'd by the Council, are made no Articles of Faith; ſo thoſe which are made ſuch, are none of the unqueſtionable Verities, but as much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputed as any. For if I miſtake not, this word <hi>ſenſerit</hi> is but twice uſed by the Council in this Matter, <hi>viz.</hi> Seſſ. 5. Chap. 5. <hi>This Concupiſcence which the Apoſtle ſomtimes calls ſin, the holy Synod de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, the Catholick Church hath never underſtood to be call'd Sin, becauſe it is truly and properly Sin in the Regenerate; but becauſe it proceeds from Sin, and inclines to Sin. But if any Man ſhall think the contrary, let him be Anathema</hi> 
                     <note n="l" place="margin">Hanc Concupiſcentiam, quam aliquando Apoſtolus peccatum appellat, ſancta Synodus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarat Eccleſiam Catholicam nunquam intellexiſſe peccatum appellari, quod vere &amp; proprie in renatis peccatum ſit; ſed quia ex peccato eſt, &amp; ad peccatum inclinat. Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis autem contrarium <hi>ſenſerit</hi> anathema ſit.</note>. And Seſſ. 25. after the Decrees concerning the Interceſſion and Invocation of Saints, the Veneration of Images and of Reliques, it is added, <hi>If any Man ſhall teach or think contrary to theſe Decrees, let him be Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> 
                     <note n="m" place="margin">Siquis autem his decretis contraria docuerit aut <hi>ſenſerit</hi> Anathema ſit.</note>.</p>
                  <p>However by this Rule, all thoſe Propoſitions are condemned as Heretical, which are contrary to thoſe Decrees of the Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Fifth Seſſion, and to the latter part of the Fifth Chapter of the Fifth Seſſion, ſuch (among many others) are theſe,</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>That Concupiſcence is truly and properly Sin.</l>
                     <l>That it is repugnant to the Word of God, to pray to the Saints with Mental as well as Vocal Prayer.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>And the contrary to theſe made neceſſary Points of Faith.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Another Rule laid down by <hi>Canus,</hi> by which it may be known, that a Decree contains Matter of Faith neceſſary to be believed, is this. <hi>If the Sentence of Excommunication be paſs'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe who ſhall contradict</hi> (or ſpeak againſt it) <note n="n" place="margin">Tertia eſt, ſi in eos qui contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dixerint (not <hi>contra ſenſerint)</hi> Excommunicationis ſententia ipſo jure feratur. ibid.</note>. Now by this Rule, not only all thoſe diſputable and falſe propoſitions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mention'd, but almoſt all the Doctrines defin'd by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:48724:52"/> are made Articles of Faith neceſſary to be believed; becauſe an <hi>Anathema</hi> is denounced, not only againſt thoſe who ſhall <hi>teach</hi> or <hi>preach,</hi> or in <hi>publick diſpute, defend</hi> the contrary Propoſitions, or ſay that the <hi>Church hath err'd</hi> in defining them; but againſt thoſe who ſhall but barely <hi>ſay the contrary</hi> to any of them.</p>
                  <p>And is it not ſtrange, that <hi>R. H.</hi> ſhould overlook this Rule? But he is to be excuſed, becauſe his deſign was to put a favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble gloſs upon this odious part of the Council: Or we may cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably ſuppoſe, that the ſight of ſo many terrible Anathema's, put him into ſuch a Fright, that he forgot himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The firſt part of the Fourth Rule, teaches that Doctrine to be neceſſary, concerning which it is expreſly ſaid, <hi>That it is firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be believed by all the Faithful</hi> 
                     <note n="o" place="margin">Quarta, ſi quicquam expreſſe &amp; proprie a fidelibus firmiter credendum, aut tanquam dogma Fidei Catholicae accipiendum dicatur, vel aliis ſimilibus verbis aliquid eſſe Evangelio doctrinaeve Apoſtolorum contrarium. ibid.</note>. By which Rule the whole Doctrine of Juſtification, Seſſ. 6. will be found to be <hi>de Fide;</hi> becauſe the Synod ſays, <hi>Except a Man do faithfully and firmly receive it, he cannot be juſtified</hi> 
                     <note n="p" place="margin">—Poſt hanc Catholicam de Juſtificatione Doctrinam, quam niſi quiſ<expan>

                  <p>There is another note propoſed by <hi>Canus,</hi> before theſe Four already mentioned, which is of ſuch large extent, that there are very few, if any of the Definitions of <hi>Trent,</hi> that will not fall within the compaſs of it. 'Tis in ſhort this,</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>The Doctrine of Conncils if propoſed to the whole Church, if propoſed alſo with an Obligation of believing it, is a neceſſary point of Faith</hi>

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:48724:53"/> Church Univerſal; in like manner as the Council expreſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes thoſe of Seſſ. 14. <hi>to be believed</hi> and held of all Chriſtians <note n="(r)" place="margin">Haec ſunt quae de Poenitentiae &amp; extremae Unctionis Sacramentis haec San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta Oecumenica Synodus profitetur &amp; docet, atque omnibus Chriſti Fidelibus credenda &amp; tenenda proponit.</note>. And that the Synod intended (what in them lay) to oblige all thoſe to whom they were propoſed, to believe them, is manifeſt by thoſe Curſes it thunders out againſt all thoſe who ſhall dare to contradict them.</p>
                  <p>I think it is now evident, That by <hi>Canus</hi> his Rules, all the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> in which Perſons are Anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized barely for affirming or denying ſuch or ſuch a Propoſition, do enjoyn aſſent under <hi>Anathema</hi> to the contradictory Propoſition.</p>

That the Lights, Odours and Veſtments uſed in the Maſs, are of Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Tradition; That the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is the Mother of all Churches.</hi> Or 3. <hi>As if any ſuch thing were now neceſſary explicite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be known, or believed abſolutely</hi> ratione medii, <hi>for attaining Salvation, which was not ſo formerly.</hi> Then none of the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions before mention'd, are now neceſſary to be believed, <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione medii.</hi> Or 4. <hi>As if there might not be ſuch a ſufficient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal made to us of ſuch a Point formerly, as that from this, we had then an Obligation to believe it.</hi> If there was ſuch a ſufficient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal formerly of all Points determin'd by the Council, how came it to paſs, that many of them were not known to be Divine Truths; no, not by thoſe Perſons who could not be ignorant of ſuch a Propoſal, if any ſuch had been? I mean the moſt Learned Men of that Church; not thoſe who were ſuſpected to have too much kindneſs for Hereticks, viz. <hi>Eraſmus, Caſſander, Wice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius, &amp;c.</hi> but the ſtouteſt Champions of the Papacy, and thoſe of higheſt Authority in that Church, next to the Pope himſelf; ſuch as Cardinal <hi>Cajetan,</hi> who not long before the Council, taught things plainly contrary to divers of the <hi>Trent</hi> Decrees. Or 5. <hi>As if the Ignorance of ſuch Point before the Definition of a Council, might not be ſome loſs in order to our Salvation. Some loſs!</hi> A man then it ſeems might have been ſaved, who held the contrary, <hi>yet ſo as by fire.</hi> That Sin therefore, which was but <hi>Venial</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Definition of the Council, became <hi>Mortal</hi> after it. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother new Article, which the Council forgat to define.</p>
                  <p>But if not in this, nor that, nor t'other ſenſe, in what ſenſe at laſt, after all theſe Limitations and Exceptions, are theſe Points made, by the Councils defining them, Articles of Faith? Why,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:48724:54"/> in no ſenſe; for they were Articles of Faith before; the only dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is, that they were then leſs neceſſary, now more neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be believed: For <hi>by the Councils deſining them, they are made neceſſary to be believed in ſome degree of neceſſity, wherein they were not before</hi> 
                     <note n="u" place="margin">
                        <hi>R. H.</hi> S. 192.</note>. But till it be proved, that they were <hi>neceſſary</hi> to be believed before, by ſome better Argument, than barely ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, we ſhall hardly be perſwaded that they are <hi>more neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> to be believed ſince.</p>
                  <p>But how comes it to be more neceſſary now than formerly, to believe theſe new old Articles? <hi>By reaſon of a more evident Propoſal of them, when the Council (whoſe Judgment we are bound to believe and ſubmit to) declares them to be Divine Truths</hi> 
                     <note n="w" place="margin">Ibid.</note>. But how come we to be bound to believe and ſubmit to the Judgment of the Council of <hi>Trent?</hi> Was it a Council of the Catholick Church? No, but of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church only. Does the Church of <hi>England</hi> owe any Subjection to the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> No, that Church had never any Dominion over her, but what was Uſurpt. Had the Church of <hi>England</hi> any Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives in the Council? No, in the Catalogue of the Biſhops, one Britiſh Biſhop is mentioned, (viz. <hi>Tho. Goduclus,</hi> Biſhop of St. <hi>Aſaph)</hi> but he had no Commiſſion from this Church. Have the Decrees and Canons of the Council been ſince received by the Church of <hi>England?</hi> No. Will it not then be a hard matter to prove, that the Members of this Church are bound to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Judgment of this Council? And yet we ſhall readily ſubmit to it; Firſt, In caſe it be once proved, (which this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſuppoſes, and takes for granted) that this Council was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible. Or 2<hi>ly,</hi> Suppoſing it hath err'd, (which is moſt notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous) That it is our Duty to aſſent to its Errors as Divine Truths.</p>
                  <p>What he ſays afterward of the obligation that lies upon us from the Definition of the Church <note n="x" place="margin">
                        <hi>R. H.</hi> S. 193.</note>, is the ſame thing repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; becauſe by <hi>the Church,</hi> he means no more than the <hi>Roman Church</hi> aſſembled at <hi>Trent:</hi> And therefore the Church of <hi>England</hi>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:48724:54"/> in not ſubmitting to her, is no way defective in her Duty of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, becauſe ſhe owes no obedience to her.</p>
                  <p>But are not the Points themſelves defined, ſuch as require our acceptance?

                  <p n="1">1. In that he ſays, <hi>The Clauſe</hi> (haec eſt Fides Catholica extra quam nemo Salvus) <hi>is a Declaration of the Pope, and can have no more Authority than other Papal Decrees</hi>

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:48724:55"/> intimating that a Papal Decree is of leſs Authority than that of a general Council; What can be ſaid more abſurd, when ſpoken with reſpect to the Council of <hi>Trent?</hi> Since this Council did not only again and again expreſly own the Pope for their Lord; <note n="(f)" place="margin">—Decrevit integrum negotium ad <hi>Sanctiſſimum Dominum noſtrum</hi> eſſe referendum.

                  <p n="2">2. He ſays, <hi>Whatever Profeſſion of Faith is made in the Bull, it concerneth not any Perſon, ſave thoſe who enter into Religious Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or into ſome Eccleſiaſtical Benefice</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. He adds, <hi>Theſe Perſons are not therein obliged to believe the Articles or Canons of</hi> Trent, <hi>in any other ſenſe than that which we have but now mentioned</hi>

                  <p>And for that Clauſe of the Bull <hi>(haec vera Catholica fides extra quam nemo ſalvus eſſe poteſt)</hi> if we take it in that limited ſenſe, which <hi>R.

Which we confeſs it would be our Duty to do, in caſe he had once proved that theſe Councils were all infallible; which he can never attempt with any ſucceſs, till he has firſt proved, that both parts of a Contradiction may be true.</p>
                  <p>As a Confirmation of his foregoing Diſcourſe, he adds in the next Section; <hi>That the moſt or chiefeſt of the</hi> Proteſtant <hi>Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies defined or made</hi> de Fide <hi>in the Council of</hi> Trent, <hi>were made ſo by former Councils of equal Obligation; or alſo were contained in the publick Liturges of the Catholick Church</hi> 
                     <note n="(s)" place="margin">§ 198.</note>. By former Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of <hi>equal Obligation,</hi> he can mean no leſs than General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, or ſuch at leaſt as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> calls ſo. Now we freely grant without his asking, that many of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Errors both in Doctrine and Worſhip, were defined and made <hi>de Fide</hi> by ſuch preceding Councils; ſuch are thoſe I have before mention'd, not as firſt defined, but as confirmed by the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> So that ſetting aſide all thoſe which were aded by <hi>Pius</hi> IV. and the <hi>Trent</hi> Fathers, we deſire no more
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:48724:56"/> to juſtifie the Reformation made before that Council aſſembled: But as the Reformation was neceſſary before, ſo (to uſe the words of our Author) it became neceſſary afterward in a <hi>new degree of neceſſity,</hi> by reaſon of thoſe new Errors defined by the Council. For how many ſoever the other <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Controverſies were, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined by former Councils; not ſo much as one of thoſe, I have before inſtanced in, was ſo defined. There are no more than three of them, that can be ſuppoſed to be comprehended in the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue <hi>R. H.</hi> hath given us of the Controverſies before defined: 1. That of the Canon of Scripture. 2. That of Confeſſion to a Prieſt as neceſſary by the Law of God. 3. That of the true and proper Sacrifice of the Maſs.</p>
                  <p>The Firſt of theſe, he ſays, was declared by the Council of <hi>Florence.</hi> But that's a Cheat firſt impoſed upon the World by <hi>Caranza,</hi> who mentions this in Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi>'s Decree given to the <hi>Armenians</hi> 
                     <note n="(t)" place="margin">Summa Concil: p. 873, 874. Edit. Rothomag. 1633.</note>.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The great <hi>Lateran</hi> Council did, I grant, enjoyn Confeſſion to a Prieſt once a year; but not from the Obligation of any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Law, that was the Invention of the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. He could, it ſeems, find no Decree of any foregoing Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, for the Sacrifice of the Maſs; but he has found ſomething elſe, which he hath put in its room, as if it were of as good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, tho' in plain contradiction to what he aſſerts about half a Page after; where he tells us, that the Definitions of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils only requires ſubmittance. But what ſays he for the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Maſs? <hi>It is, he ſays, apparent in the Liturgies of the Church preceding the Council of</hi> Trent. Is it ſo? and ſo is the ſtory of the Seven Sleepers <note n="(u)" place="margin">Breviarium ad uſum Eccleſ. Sarisburienſ.</note>, and many more which are fit for nothing, but to move Indignation or Laughter. And are theſe all Articles of Faith too? But if all Matters de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in the Liturgies of the Church before the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> were Matters of Faith; how came the <hi>Trent</hi> Fathers to think it
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:48724:56"/> neceſſary to correct many things in their Miſſal and Breviary? And how many Articles of Faith are now loſt, by being left out of the reformed Breviary of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> V. ſo that how much ſoever we owe them for their new Articles, we are little behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them for robbing us of ſo many old; and thoſe ſome of them very pleaſant ones. And yet the loſs is the leſs, becauſe they were ſuch, as they themſelves were aſhamed any longer to own to the world.</p>
                  <p>And yet after all, it is to be conſidered, That a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> is one thing, and <hi>a true and proper Sacrifice</hi> is another. As the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and, I ſuppoſe, every other Proteſtant Church aſſerts a Sacrifice; ſo, I fear, no Liturgy of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> can be-produced, preceding the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> in which it is called a true and proper Sacrifice.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>R. H.</hi> will ſay, What need of Proof, when this is no more than what ſeems to be acknowledged by Biſhop <hi>Bramhall,</hi>

But let us hear the Biſhop's words. <hi>Theſe very Points,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>which Pope</hi> Pius IV. <hi>comprehended in a new Symbol or Creed, were obtruded upon us before by his Predeceſſors, as neceſſary Articles of the</hi> Roman <hi>Faith.

Where lies the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence? Were General Councils, Pope <hi>Pius</hi> his Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors? Or were the Popes (his Predeceſſors) general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils? But be it ſo, that Popes only, and not Councils, were his Predeceſſors; yet by the help of an <hi>(i. e.)</hi> thoſe rods which were faſhion'd by Popes, were faſhioned by Councils too; For <hi>they (viz.</hi> the Popes) <hi>faſhioned the rods,</hi> i. e. <hi>in the Synods held in the Church before</hi> Luthers <hi>appearance</hi>

He ſays indeed, not becauſe it is <hi>in it ſelf,</hi> for the matter, neceſſary to be believed; but becauſe it is defined by the Church, which is <hi>infallibly aſſiſted.</hi> But does not this render the Tyranny of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, ſo much the more intolerable, unleſs he alſo prove, that ſhe is in all her Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſo <hi>infallibly aſſiſted?</hi> Which if he once do, no Proteſtant, I preſume, will ever again call in queſtion any of her Propoſals.</p>
                  <p>But now the Church of <hi>England</hi> does not require any man to believe that all her deciſions, contrary to thoſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Points of Faith; She cenſures no man for <hi>thinking,</hi> but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for <hi>ſpeaking</hi> or <hi>acting;</hi> and not for ſaying, That all her Doctrine is not <hi>infallibly true,</hi> but that any part of it is <hi>falſe;</hi> She excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates thoſe only, who affirm, that her Articles are erroneous.

                  <p>This is yet further evident, by the ſubſcription required of thoſe who are admitted to holy Orders, or to any Eccleſiaſtical Benefice. What is it they ſubſcribe to? That the Book of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer was compos'd by men infallibly aſſiſted? That the 39 Articles are as neceſſary as the Apoſtles Creed? No. But 1. <hi>That the Book of Common-Prayer, and of ordering of Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons, containeth in it nothing contrary to the word of God, and that it may lawfully be uſed</hi>

                  <p>But now in what a lofty ſtrain does the Subſcription to <hi>Pius</hi>'s Creed run? <hi>All things delivered, defined and declared by Sacred Canons, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Councils, and eſpecially by the Council of</hi> Trent, <hi>I undoubtedly receive and confeſs; and withal I Condemn, Reject and Accurſe all things contrary, and all Hereſies whatſoever, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, rejected and accurſed by the Church.

                  <p>Again, Can. 6. of the Synod held under <hi>Charles</hi> I. <hi>Anno</hi> 1640. the form of Subſcription runs thus, <hi>I</hi> A.

                  <p>I have, I think, ſufficiently proved, That the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> inſtead of making any Reformation in Faith and Worſhip, did on the contrary, not only confirm theſe Corruptions it found, but ſuperadded many to them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Nor did it only cauſe a greater Deformity in Faith and Worſhip, but in Diſcipline too. This will be evident, by ſhewing theſe two things: 1. What Corruptions in Diſcipline were
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:48724:58"/> ſtrengthned and confirmed by it. 2. What were created, or introduced anew.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What Corruptions in Diſcipline were ſtrengthned and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by it. Not that I intend a compleat Enumeration of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, (that would be too tedious a Work) but only to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſome of the greater, and ſo comprehenſive of miſchief, that as long as they remain, 'tis in vain to hope for any good Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in Diſcipline.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Popes Abſolute Supremacy, or his Superiority over a General Council (which tho a point of Doctrine, is the chief point of Diſcipline too). I grant what <hi>R. H.</hi> ſays, <hi>That this paſſed not from the Council as any Decree</hi> 
                     <note n="(i)" place="margin">§ 155.</note>. But if the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil be Infallible, Is it not the ſame thing to acknowledg, <hi>That he hath the Adminiſtration of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church,</hi> as they expreſly do in one of their Decrees <note n="(k)" place="margin">Seſſ. 25. c. 1. de Reformat. general.</note>? But, ſuppoſe there was not a word in any Decree that looked this way; is it not enough that their Actions loudly declared it? Did they not in all caſes conſult his Holineſs as their Oracle? Was any thing almoſt treated of without his Direction? Was any thing determined with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his leave? Did they not ſubmit all their Decrees to him, to be either diſpenſed with, or interpreted to what ſenſe he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed? Does not the whole Conduct of the Council from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to the end ſpeak his Superiority? Was it not convened, continued, tranſlated, ſuſpended, diſſolved by the Popes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand? In a word, did they not in all things behave themſelves towards him, as their Lord and Maſter? And is not a conſtant Tenor of Actions, a more real owning of his Supremacy, than the largeſt Recognition in Words only? Does not the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative of the Nation more effectually acknowledg the Kings Sovereignty, by coming and going at his command; by acting, or ſuſpending their acting, as he directs; by ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all their Reſolves to him, and acknowleding that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they do, is of no force unleſs confirmed by him; than by

                  <p n="2">2. The Exemption of Eccleſiaſticks from the Juriſdiction of Temporal Princes. This Immunity the Council tells us, is by the appointment of God; and therefore Decrees and Commands, <hi>That the Sacred Conons, and all General Councils, and other Papal Conſtitutions in favour of Eccleſiaſtical Perſons, and the Liberty of the Church (all which by this preſent Decree it renews) ought to be exactly obſerved by all men</hi>

                  <p>Now the Immunities of the Clergy, which are ſaid to be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by General Councils, and Papal Conſtitutions, are theſe, and ſuch like: That they take no Oath of Allegiance to their Prince <note n="(p)" place="margin">Concil.

And is not that Church like to be well governed, and kept in excellent order, where ſo numerous and conſiderable a Body of men, as the Clergy, own no Subjection to, or dependance upon their Prince?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Another great Abuſe confirmed by this Council, is the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicating of Princes, and depriving them of their Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. It Decrees, <hi>That the Emperor, Kings, Dukes, Princes, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſes,</hi>
                     <pb n="113" facs="tcp:48724:59"/> 
                     <hi>Earls, and all Temporal Lords, of what Title ſoever, who ſhall grant a place for Duelling in their Dominions among Chriſtians, ſhall</hi> eo ipſo, <hi>be Excommunicated, and Deprived of the Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Dominion of the City, Caſtle or Place, where ſuch a Duel was permitted, if they were held in Fee from the Church; but if from others, then they ſhall eſcheat to their Principal Lords</hi>

                  <p>But we ſhall more fully underſtand what Liberty this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil hath taken to Excommunicate Princes, if we conſult ſome of thoſe General Councils and Papal Conſtitutions, which in favour of Churchmen it renews and confirms. Pope <hi>Boniſace</hi> VIII. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicates by his Decretal, Emperors, Kings, Dukes, Counts, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, and all other of whatſoever Preeminence, Condition or State, that ſhall impoſe any Collection, Taxes, Tenths,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>upon Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, without the Popes leave; together with all Eccleſiaſtical Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that ſhall pay them</hi>

That of <hi>Innocent</hi> was paſſed in the great <hi>Lateran</hi> Council, in which were Twelve hundred Fathers, and by it, not only <hi>Conſuls and Governors of Cities,</hi> but <hi>others</hi> alſo, who ſhall preſume to burden Eccleſiaſticks with Tolls, Taxes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are excommunicated <note n="(y)" place="margin">Concil.

And that the word <hi>others,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to Kings and Princes, we are taught by no leſs Authority than the fifth <hi>Lateran</hi> Council <note n="(z)" place="margin">Seſſ. 9.</note>, which is another of thoſe which the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> commands to be obſerved: Now this
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:48724:60"/> 
                     <hi>Lateran</hi> Council having promiſed, <hi>That no Power is either by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine or Human Laws given to Laymen over Churchmen;</hi> it inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates all the Conſtitutions of foregoing Popes, made in favour of Eccleſiaſtical Liberty, and inforces all the Penalties contain'd in <hi>Bulla Caenae Domini:</hi> And particularly it Excommunicates Kings and Princes, who ſhall impoſe any Taxes upon Churchmen, or receive any from them, tho they pay them willingly <note n="(a)" place="margin">Ibid.</note>.</p>
                  <p>I might inſtance in many more, but it is needleſs in a matter ſo notorious. The <hi>Bulla Coenoe Domini,</hi> as it was publiſhed by <hi>Paul</hi> III. (without thoſe Additions which have been ſince made) is it ſelf alone an irrefragable Evidence of the Judgment of this Council, as to the excommunicating of Kings: For in that Bull, <hi>all ſecular Powers are excommunicated, who call any Eccleſiaſtical Perſons to their Tribunals, Courts,</hi> &amp;c. <note n="(b)" place="margin">Bulla Pauli III. Idib Apr. 1536. Bullarii Rom Tom. 2.</note>. And this Bull was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd before the Convocation the <hi>Trent</hi> Council, and twenty ſeven years before the Decree mentioned was made by the Council, and therefore was confirmed by it: And if any Prince ſtands a year excommunicated, he is judged a Schiſmatick and Heretick; and what puniſhment he is then liable to, I need not tell you.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Another groſs Abuſe confirm'd by this Council, is giving the Pope the Election into Biſhopricks in foreign Dominions. As the form of Examination of Perſons fit to govern the Churches in every Province, is to be approved by the Pope; ſo when the Examination is finiſh'd, it is to be reduced into a publick Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſent to him, to be examined by four Cardinals, and propoſed in Conſiſtory; that his Holineſs having full knowledg of the whole matter, and of the Perſons, if by the Examination and Inquiſition made, they ſhall be found fit, he may out of them profitably provide for the Churches <note n="(c)" place="margin">Seſſ. 24. Cap 1.</note>.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The reſerving of all ſuch weighty criminal cauſes of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, as deſerve Depoſition and Deprivation, to the Popes Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance and Deciſion. And if the Cauſe be ſuch, as it muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:48724:60"/> be tried out of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> that it be committed to none, except ſuch Metropolitans and Biſhops as the Pope ſhall chuſe: But that the Commiſſion be ſpecial, and ſealed with the Popes own Seal, and that he never give them any more Power, than barely to take Inſtruction of matter of Fact, and to make the Proceſs, which they ſhall forthwith ſend to the Pope; the definitive Sentence being reſerved to his Holineſs <note n="(d)" place="margin">Seſſ. 24. Cap. 5.</note>. Now as this, and the Abuſe next foregoing, are both intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Uſurpations upon the Rights of Princes; ſo they make the Biſhops in the whole Chriſtian Church, intirely dependent on the Pope; He may ſet them up, and pull them down at his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. And is not the Univerſal Church like to be well governed, when all the Biſhops are at the Popes beck?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Exemptions of Monaſtick Orders from the Juriſdiction of Biſhops. This Abuſe had been complain'd of long before, as the great bane of Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline, and the chief cauſe of the lewd and ſcandalous Lives of the Monks; and the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it was demanded of the Council by the Emperors Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors <note n="(e)" place="margin">Soav. p. 513.</note>. And what did the Council do in order to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of this grand Abuſe? Did they aboliſh all Exemptions al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready granted, and forbid the granting of any more for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? No, they ordained indeed, That no Secular Clerk, nor Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, dwelling out of his Moneſtry, ſhould be exempted (if he offended) from being viſited, puniſhed and corrected by the Ordinary of the place, <hi>As Delegate of the Apoſtolick See</hi> 
                     <note n="(f)" place="margin">Seſſ. 6. cap. 3.</note>. That the Chapters of Cathedrals, and other greater Churches, by no Exemptions, Cuſtoms, Oaths, or Agreements, ſhould be freed from being viſited and corrected by their Biſhops, and other greater Prelats, by <hi>Apoſtolical Authority</hi> 
                     <note n="(g)" place="margin">Seſſ 6. <hi>c.</hi> 4.</note>. That the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary of the place, ſhall every year by the <hi>Apoſtolical Authority,</hi> viſit all Churches, however exempted <note n="(h)" place="margin">Seſſ. 7. cap. 8.</note>. That all Secular Clerks notwithſtanding any Exemptions, Declarations, Cuſtoms,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:48724:61"/> Oaths, Agreements, ſhall as oft as there is need, be corrected and chaſtized for their Exceſſes and Faults, by the Biſhops reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in their Churches, <hi>as Delegates of the Apoſtolick See</hi> 
                     <note n="i" place="margin">Seſſ. 14. cap. 4.</note>. That the Monaſtries held in <hi>Commendam,</hi> the Abbies, Priories, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not tied to a Regular obſervance, ſhall be viſited by the Biſhops, <hi>as Delegates of the Apoſtolick See</hi> 
                     <note n="k" place="margin">Seſſ. 21. cap. 8.</note>. But for thoſe Monaſteries and other Religious houſes, in which they are tied to Regular Obſervance, the Biſhops ſhall provide by Paternal Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, that the Superiors obſerve their Regular Conſtitutions, and cauſe them to be obſerved by thoſe that are under them; and if within ſix months after Admonition, they do not viſit and correct them, then the Biſhops, <hi>as Delegates of the Apoſtolick See,</hi> may proceed to Viſitation and Correction.</p>
                  <p>This is (as I take it) the ſum of what the Council hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed concerning Exemptions. In which obſerve, 1. That the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops have nothing to do with any Regulars of what Order ſoever, who do not dwell out of their Religious houſes, in caſe their Superiors take care, that they obſerve the Rules of their Order: By which, vaſt numbers of men are left at liberty to defie the Biſhops, and to create to them all manner of Moleſtation. 2. In caſe their Superiors neglect their Duty, the Biſhops cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to viſit, till they have firſt paternally admoniſhed them; and their ſix months further neglect, after ſuch Admonition. But 3. That which I chiefly obſerve is; That not only no Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, whether Regular, or not Regular, but not ſo much as any Churches or Chapters, are otherways ſubjected to the Biſhops, than as they are the Popes Delegates, they act purely by a Power derived from him, which he may therefore either revoke, or contract at his Pleaſure. A fine Sham! Are not the Biſhops high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promoted? They may now viſit and correct Churches, Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Colleges, Monaſteries, Abbies, Priories, Provoſtſhips: Yes; ſo far, and ſo often as the Pope gives them leave.</p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:48724:61"/>
                  <p> We have ſeen that the <hi>Trent</hi> Council was ſo far from making any real Reformation in Diſcipline, that it not only took no effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual courſe for the removal of any Abuſe, but on the contrary confirmed many; and thoſe ſuch as were of all others moſt pregnant with miſchief. And yet this is not the worſt; for as it confirmed the old, ſo</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It introduced many new Errors in matters of Diſcipline (as well as Doctrine) by which the Popes Tyranny was enlarged, and advanced to a higher pitch than ever. Several of which have been already mention'd, and therefore I ſhall not now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large upon them. As</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Decree of <hi>Proponentibus Legatis</hi> paſs'd in the firſt Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fion under <hi>Pius</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. The giving the Pope a Power to expound their Decrees (as we have alſo before heard) in caſe any difficulty ariſe about the ſenſe of them, or a neceſſity of Declaration <note n="n" place="margin">Seſſ. 25.</note>, which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver granted by any former Council. They might as well have left it to him to make them, as they in effect did, for nothing was decreed without firſt asking his leave.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The impoſing on Provincial and Dioceſan Synods an Oath of true Obedience to the Pope <note n="o" place="margin">Seſſ. 25. cap. 2.</note>, another new piece of Tyranny; for tho the Biſhops at their Conſecration fomerly took an Oath of Fidelity to him; yet never before was any Oath impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon them, when met together in Provincial and Dioceſan Synods.</p>

Whereas anciently every Biſhop governed his own Dioceſs, without Dependence upon, or Subordination to the Pope; by the Laws of <hi>Trent,</hi> they can do almoſt nothing, unleſs by Delegation from him. May Biſhops provide Vicars to ſupply the room of ſuch Clergymen as are diſpenſed with for non-reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and aſſign them a competent Salary out of the Fruits?

                  <p>Many more Inſtances of like nature might be produced, but theſe may ſuffice to ſhew how palpably untrue that Aſſertion of <hi>Pallavicino</hi>'s is, viz. <hi>That there is not ſo much as one Syllable in this Council for any new Emolument to the Pope</hi>

For as all thoſe Decrees, that might otherwiſe have retrenched their Exorbitances, were themſelves ſo clipt by Exceptions or Reſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, or by ſome other Counter Decree, that they could effect nothing; ſo many other Decrees were made, by which the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the Pope and his Court were highly promoted; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly this laſt mention'd, <hi>of deriving all Juriſdiction from the Pope, by making all other Biſhops his Vicars and Commiſſaries.</hi> And therefore no wonder, that his Holineſs was tranſported with Joy, and gave immortal Thanks, that the Council had ſuch an happy Iſſue <note n="(z)" place="margin">Pallav. l. 24. c. 9. n. 5.</note>. <hi>For</hi> (to uſe the words of <hi>Du Ranchin) you ſhall never read of any Council that was ſo much to the Popes Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and good liking as this.
